This is the second part of the results of this thesis. Here we will discuss some of the possible ways to modify the physical properties of 2D materials. As before, each section will be focused on an unique way to change the properties of materials, namely number of layers, mechanical strain, adatom adsorption, heterostructure and defect induction. In consist with the theme of the thesis, which is about novel 2D materials, we will continue to introduce other new 2D that has been discovered and whose properties will be modified. Some of the studies here are the continuum of the works in the previous chapter where properties are determined only, here those properties will be modified. 




\section{Number of layers}
\subsection[Few-layer of Calcium hydroxide]{Few-layer of Calcium hydroxide \footcite[This work is published in:][]{Aierken2015.porlandite}}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

We have seen several monolayer systems that exacted from layered materials such 2D-BN, 2D-MoS$_2$, in this work, we further explore this process for alkaline earth metal hydroxides (AEMHs), which pose a layered structure in the bulk form. It was exfoliated  to few-layer, the experiment and the theoretical modelling is reported in this section. In contrast to the abundant literature on graphenelike ultra-thin structures, few-layer AEMHs have not been investigated so far. Bulk forms of AEMHs are layered structures belonging to the $P\overline{3}m1$ space group\cite{structure1} and the crystal structure of a layered AEMHs comprises stacked sheets of MO$_6$ (M=alkaline earth metals) edge-sharing octahedra, see \autoref{fig:str_caoh2}. At each corner of an octahedron, each O atom binds one H atom and the latter interacts with three neighboring hydroxyl groups of the adjacent layer. Early studies on bulk AEMHs revealed that the application of temperature and pressure may result in dramatical changes in their crystal structure and their electronic properties\cite{amorphization1,amorphization2,amorphization3,amorphization4,transition1,transition2,transition3,transition4} . Moreover, early theoretical studies showed the reliability of the use of first principle calculations with a plane-waves basis set in combination with the generalized gradient approximation exchange-correlation functional for the investigation of structural and electronic properties of these materials\cite{Winkler1995,Baranek2001,Azuma2011,DArco1993}.

\caption{\label{fig:str_caoh2} Atomic structure of bulk Ca(OH)$_2$: (a)
tilted view, (b) top view of one layer. }
\end{figure}

Although the structural and electronic properties of bulk AEMHs have been
investigated before \cite{Azuma2011,Pishtshev,Pishtshev1} , single layers of 
these materials have never been studied before and their stability is 
still an open question. However, advances 
in experimental techniques made exfoliation and growth of such 
structures possible\cite{new1,new2}. Especially the Portlandite material, Ca(OH)$_2$,
which has been the 
main product of hydration of Portland cement, CaO, is one of the most well-known 
AEHMs, characteristic properties of ultra-thin structures of Portlandite have 
not been reported yet. In this study we investigate, both experimentally and theoretically, 
the structural, electronic, magnetic, vibrational and mechanical 
characteristics of bulk, bilayer and monolayer Ca(OH)$_{2}$ and discuss how these properties change with the number of layers.  Particularly, the result of the phonon calculation is presented for the confirmation of the stability of the newly proposed 2D material.

To assess the mechanical strength of the material, in addition to the elastic moduli that we have introduced in \autoref{chap:3}, here we calculate another useful parameter that closely related to the Young's modulus, which is called the in-plane stiffness of the materials. We 
focused on the harmonic range of the elastic deformation, where the structure 
responded linearly to strain $\epsilon$. The stretching of the Ca(OH)$_{2}$ is 
achieved by increasing the equilibrium lattice constant a$_{0}$ by $\Delta$a, 
to attain the axial strain $\epsilon$ = $\Delta$a/a$_{0}$. We optimized the 
atomic structure at each increment of the strain, $\Delta\epsilon$ =0.01 and 
calculated the total energy under strain E$_{T}$($\epsilon$). Then the strain 
energy can be given by, E$_{S}$ = E$_{T}$($\epsilon$) - E$_{T}$($\epsilon$=0); 
namely, the total energy at a given strain $\epsilon$ minus the total energy at 
zero strain. Then, using the following formula, one can calculate the in-plane 
stiffness: 
\begin{equation}
 C = (\dfrac{1}{A_{0}})(\dfrac{d^{2}E_{S}}{d\epsilon^{2}}),
\end{equation}
where A$_{0}$ is the equilibrium area of the supercell.

As explained in detail in the following sections, unitcells including one Ca,
two O and two H are the primitive cells of both monolayer and bulk structures, 
it is doubled for bilayer. Cohesive energy per unit cell,
$E_{coh}$ is presented in \autoref{tab:str2_caoh2} and is calculated according to the formula:
$E_{coh}=E_{tot}-nE_{Ca}-2nE_O-2nE_H$, where $E_{tot}$ is the total energy
of the unit cell of Ca(OH)$_2$, $E_X$ is the single atom total energy of atom $X$
and $n$ is the number of Ca atoms for the corresponding unit cell, i.e.
$n=1$, $n=2$ and $n=1$ for monolayer, bilayer and bulk, respectively.

\subsubsection{Experimental measurements}


Before our theoretical investigation of few-layer Ca(OH)$_{2}$, first we 
present the experimental realization and detailed theoretical analysis of the
characteristics of bulk Ca(OH)$_{2}$ crystals.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{exp_caoh2.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:exp_caoh2} (a) Optical image of the crystal structure and (b) Raman 
spectrum measured using 488 nm laser in the low and the high frequency region. 
The fundamental phonon branches located at the low frequency (100-400 cm$^{-1}$  range) and the high frequency (~3620 cm$^{-1}$) are associated with the OH  stretching mode. (c) XRD measurements}
\end{figure}

Ca(OH)$_{2}$ crystals were grown using the hydrolysis technique by using 
Ca$_{3}$SiO$_{5}$ micro-pallets. Ca$_{3}$SiO$_{5}$ was mixed at different water 
to solid ratios ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 by molar weight. The mixture was heated 
up to 40 $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in a controlled reaction chamber for 3 hours and 
controllably cooled down to 5 $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for 24 hours using a
temperature controller. The growth time depends on the total water to solid 
ratio as well as the growth temperature. Growth time was around 8 hours for 0.6 
water to solid ratio and 40 $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ growth temperature. 
Longer growth time typically resulted in a dendritic morphology where the 
growth was mostly in the c-axis direction. Synthesized crystals displayed rather sharp (FWHM ~ 7 cm$^{-1}$) Raman feature at 280 cm$^{-1}$ and our XRD measurements displayed sharp (00l) reflections at 19.1, 39, 56.2, 77.7 degrees implying that crystals have lamellar nature.  
 

Synthesized crystals were around 0.1-2 mm in size and they 
were filtered from the solution. After the filtering process, crystallites were 
washed off using 18.2 MOhm.cm DI wafer multiple times and dried under inert Ar 
gas. Crystallites were exfoliated using micro-mechanical exfoliation technique 
onto thermal silicon oxide / Si substrates. We find that the contrast 
was improved for an oxide thickness around 265-285 nm.
Exfoliated flakes displayed rather sharp edges (see \autoref{fig:exp_caoh2}) with 
well-defined angles of 120\textdegree ~and 60\textdegree ~implying that the 
materials are highly crystalline. Interestingly, synthesized Ca(OH)$_{2}$ flakes 
are layered in agreement with theoretical calculations and these flakes can be 
easily exfoliated using the Scotch tape technique on different substrates. 
The exfoliated flakes do not show any signs of structural imperfection, pit 
formation, and overall rather flat surfaces can be obtained. In \autoref{fig:exp_caoh2}, the 
yellowish looking regions actually correspond to regions where the thickness is 
around 50-100 nm (50-100 layers) while the blue features are only 10-50 nm in 
thickness. Considering the ease to exfoliate this material, experimentally and 
theoretically we predict that they can be eventually isolated down to mono- and 
few-layers on various substrates.

In addition, micro-Raman measurements were performed using a 488 nm laser on a 
2 micron square spot using a high intensity laser of 10 mW. We noticed that 
few-layers of Ca(OH)$_{2}$ were not subject to local over-heating / 
decomposition effects unlike transition metal dichalcogenides (MoS$_2$, 
WS$_2$, etc.) which typically decompose around 100 microWatt power using a 
similar laser excitation spot. We attribute this to the low absorption of the 
material associated with the rather large band gap. Raman measurements 
displayed various peaks in the 100-1000 cm$^{-1}$ range. The high frequency peak 
at 3620 cm$^{-1}$ is associated with the O-H stretching mode $A_{1g}$. In 
addition, the low frequency $E_u(T)$ mode is found at 280 cm$^{-1}$.  

Here, we note that even though this material is a direct gap semiconductor, 
their band gap is well beyond our detectors range and since the insulators 
cannot be excited with such high laser wavelength, PL measurements are 
virtually impossible.

\subsubsection{Structure properties}\label{strcuture}

The bulk structure of Portlandite is formed by the stacking of individual Ca(OH)$_2$ monolayers on top of each other, see \autoref{fig:str_caoh2}. As we will exam and discuss the stacking in detail in the following paragraphs, we learned that the AA stacking is the ground state atomic configuration for bulk and multilayer structures of Ca(OH)$_2$. In \autoref{tab:str_caoh2}, optimized lattice parameters of the bulk structure together with experiments and other theoretical calculation are presented. Our results consist with reference \cite{Pishtshev} and together they have good agreement with experiments. This justify the reliability of our calculations. 

In the 5-atomic hexagonal primitive unit cell of bulk Ca(OH)$_2$, the Ca atom sits at the geometrical
center of the cell, i.e. $\left\lbrace 1/2a, 1/2b,
1/2c \right\rbrace$. Two O and two H atoms form two hydroxyl groups 
(-OH$^-$) located symmetrically with respect to the Ca atom. In this 
arrangement, coordinates of H and O only differ by their positions along the 
\textbf{c} lattice axis and their fractional coordinates can be given as
$\left\lbrace1/6a, 1/6b, (1/2c-c_O) \right\rbrace$ and $\left\lbrace 
1/6a, 1/6b, (1/2c-c_H) \right\rbrace$ for one hydroxyl,
$\left\lbrace 5/6a, 5/6b, (1/2c+c_O) \right\rbrace$
and $\left\lbrace 5/6a, 5/6b, (1/2c+c_H)
\right\rbrace$ for the other one, where c$_O$ and c$_H$ are the vertical shifts
of the positions of O and H atoms from the Ca plane in the unit of \AA~, respectively.

In the optimized structure, the lattice constants $a$ and $c$ are 3.61 \AA~and 4.98 \AA~in the bulk structure, parameters c$_O$ and c$_H$ are calculated to be 1.15 \AA~and 2.12 \AA . Bond length of Ca-O and O-H are 2.36 \AA~ and 0.97 \AA . Interlayer distance which is defined as the distance between the uppermost H-layer of the underlying layer and the lowermost H-layer  of the top-lying layer is found to be 0.49 \AA~. Differing from other lamellar bulk crystal structures such as graphite (3.58 \AA) and MoS$_{2}$ (3.42 \AA)\cite{can} , Ca(OH)$_{2}$ layers are more closely stacked on top of each other. 

Our calculations revealed that going from bulk to monolayer the in-plane lattice parameter $a$ change to 3.62 \AA~. In our calculations, the c lattice parameter in the hexagonal unit cell of the monolayer is set to 25 \AA~in order to avoid interlayer interaction between the adjacent layers. In the monolayer Ca(OH)$_2$, parameters c$_O$ and c$_H$ are calculated to be c$_O$=1.14 \AA~and c$_{H}$=2.10 \AA~, respectively. Ca-O and O-H bond distances are 2.38 \AA~and 0.97 \AA~in the monolayer, respectively. We observed only quite small change as the system going from bulk to monolayer, some of the structure parameters even left unchanged, from this we can conclude quite weak interlayer interaction in Ca(OH)$_2$. In order to study the interlayer interaction we further investigate their effect on stacking, and by including the vdW correction in the functional we are able to identify the nature of this interaction.

Individual layers of lamellar structures such as graphite, hex-BN and TMDs 
are held together mainly by the van der Waals force in order to form a bulk 
layered structure. Such a weak interaction stems from dynamical correlations 
between 
fluctuating charge distributions in neighboring layers. Here we 
investigated the energies of various bilayer configurations. As presented
in \autoref{fig:stack_caoh2} there are six possible types of stacking between two 
Ca(OH)$_2$ monolayers. Similar to the stacking nomenclature of bilayer graphene, 
we classify the stacking types to be either AA or ABn (n=1,2,...,5). The 
same type of atoms from different monolayers are on top of each other in AA 
stacking whereas AB stackings can be reached by shifting one of the layers along 
certain lattice vectors. One set of AB stackings could be realized by shifting 
the second layer in the AA stacking towards [$\overline{1}\overline{1}0$], 
which gives stacking AB1, and by shifting towards the [110] direction, which 
gives stacking AB2, see first row in \autoref{fig:stack_caoh2}. Another set of 
bilayers are achieved by first flipping the second layer upside down in AA 
stacking, which
would gives stacking AB3, then AB4 and AB5 can be constructed by doing the 
same shifting on the second layer of AB3 towards [$\overline{1}\overline{1}0$] 
and [110] directions of the 1st layer, respectively. After relaxation of all 
stackings, the variation of the \textbf{a} lattice constant among the different 
stacking types is less than 0.01 \AA~. The smallest interlayer
distance, as defined previously for bulk, is for AA stacking which equals
0.49 \AA~, the same as that in bulk. For AB
stacking the interlayer distance is 1$\sim$2 \AA ~larger than that for AA
stacking. As depicted in \autoref{fig:stack_caoh2}, AA stacking is 96$\sim$137 meV
per formula more favorable than all other possible stacking types and hence it
corresponds to the lowest energy configuration.

\end{figure}

To investigate the nature of the interlayer interaction, we 
have calculated the interlayer interaction energy (IE) for the AA stacked 
bilayer structure of Ca(OH)$_2$. The IE is the energy difference between the 
total energy at a specific interlayer distance and that of a well
separated bilayer. The plot of IE versus interlayer distance is shown in Fig. 
\ref{fig:int_caoh2}, where the energy of the  well separated bilayer is defined as 
0 eV. Two sets of calculations were performed, one set only considers GGA 
exchange correlation; while another set considers both the GGA and vdW 
interaction. At the optimized interlayer distance for the bilayer structure, 
almost 2/3 of the attractive interaction comes from the van der Waals 
interaction, and this is consist with \citet{DArco1993} . They stated that
interlayer interaction of Brucite, one of the isomorphous of Portlandite, is
mainly a dispersion-type interaction. The nature of interlayer interaction in Ca(OH)$_2$ is mainly vdW type weak interaction. Our GGA+vdW calculations revealed that the interlayer interaction between two layers of Ca(OH)$_2$ (149 meV per formula) is much stronger than that of bilayers of MoS$_2$ (76 meV per formula).


\subsubsection{Electronic properties}\label{sec:electronic}


Our Bader charge transfer analysis showed that the final (initial) electron 
charge on Ca, O and H atoms after (before) the formation of the crystal are 
6.4$e$ (8.0$e$), 7.4$e$ (6.0$e$) and 0.4$e$ (1.0$e$), respectively. Therefore, 
in the bulk structure of Ca(OH)$_2$, Ca-O bonds, which are 
mostly in ionic character, are formed through 0.8$e$ charge transfer 
from each Ca to O atom.  Charge transfer is kept unchanged when it comes to the monolayer structure, except for the rest charge on H atom is 0.6$e$ in monolayer.


Our calculations on the electronic structure reveal that bulk Ca(OH)$_2$ is 
an insulator with a 4.37 eV direct band gap. As shown in \autoref{fig:elec_caoh2} (a), the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction 
band minimum (CBM) are located at the $\Gamma$ point. The partial density of 
states (DOS) shown in \autoref{fig:str_caoh2} (b) indicates that the major 
contribution to the states at the valence and conduction band edge originates 
from the O atoms, while deeper in the conduction band, states are mainly composed 
of the orbitals of Ca. The orbital character of a state at a particular band can 
also be deduced from a band and $k$-point decomposed charge density. As seen 
from \autoref{fig:elec_caoh2} (c), edges in the top of VBM have O-$p_x$ 
and O-$p_y$ orbital character, and the hybridization of these states are also 
shown in the same figure. While the CBM has some $p_z$ orbital 
character from the O atoms, but as the energy of the state increases, the $d$ 
orbitals from Ca atom start to contribute, see \circled{8} in the same figure.


Electronic properties of Ca(OH)$_2$ are quite different from similar
two-dimensional graphene-like structures. Unlike TMDs (such as MoS$_2$ and
WSe$_2$) that exhibit indirect-to-direct band gap crossover when going
from bulk to a single layer structure, Ca(OH)$_2$ is a direct band gap
semiconductor which is independent of the number of layers. Although the energy band gap
at the $\Gamma$ point decreases from 4.03 to 3.67 eV for a monolayer structure,
electronic dispersion of the valence band edge remains almost unchanged, see
\autoref{fig:elec_caoh2} (d). As shown in \autoref{fig:elec_caoh2} (e)  
the conduction states mainly originate from Ca atoms, while the valence states 
are mainly composed of the orbitals of O atoms. 

Our magnetic state analysis shows that unless a defect is formed in/on the 
structure, there is no spin polarization in the ground state of both bulk and monolayer Ca(OH)$_2$. Therefore, Ca(OH)$_2$ is a non-magnetic insulator regardless of its dimension for the structure. 

Moreover, it was seen that the spin-orbit interaction has no 
considerable effect on the bond lengths and the overall electronic dispersion 
(except for a 26 meV splitting in the VBM at the 
$\Gamma$ point, see \autoref{fig:elec_caoh2} (f)). Due to the presence of inversion symmetry of Ca(OH)$_2$, the 
degeneracy of spin-up and spin-down states still remains, this is also confirmed 
by the results of our calculation.

monolayer and bilayer Ca(OH)$_2$ at the $\Gamma$ point.}
\end{figure}

Band and $k$-point decomposed charge density in \autoref{fig:elec_caoh2} are 
kept with the same isosurface level for comparison. However, as we further 
reduced the isosurface level at \circled{4} in (d) and (g) of \autoref{fig:elec_caoh2}, which is the lowest conduction band of the 
monolayer at the $\Gamma$ point: $E_{c1}^{~\Gamma}$, charge density forms a planar 
state parallel to the layer on both sides, see \autoref{fig:suf_caoh2} (a), this
is also the case for the second lowest non-spin-resolved conduction band at the same
$k$-point: $E_{c2}^{~\Gamma}$, see \autoref{fig:suf_caoh2} (b). These two states are 
important due to their unique character and having energy right below ionization energy. Such exceptional states 
having free-electron-like dispersion were reported before\cite{Posternak1,Posternak2} for 
doped graphite. To study the trend in these states, the same states were plotted 
for bilayer Ca(OH)$_2$, see (c) and (d) in \autoref{fig:suf_caoh2}. $E_{c1}^{~\Gamma}$ and $E_{c2}^{~\Gamma}$ have lower energies than ionization energy. Therefore, electrons are still close and bond to both sides of monolayers as seen from charge density. In the case of bilayer, interestingly, these states appear only on one side of bilayer.

\subsubsection{Mechanical properties}

We present the quantities that describe the mechanical 
properties of Ca(OH)$_2$ in \autoref{tab:str2_caoh2}. 
At first, the in-plane Young's modulus of the bulk structure is calculated. 
Bulk Ca(OH)$_2$ has a in-plane Young's modulus (55.0 N/m) and in-plane shear 
modulus (21.23 N/m). Both these quantities indicating flexible nature to in-plane 
tensile and shear deformation of bulk Ca(OH)$_2$. In addition, bulk Ca(OH)$_2$ has 
an in-plane Poisson's ratio of 0.30.  Additionally, the value of the in-plane 
stiffness for bulk Ca(OH)$_{2}$ is calculated to be 60.1 J/m$^{2}$. 

If we go from bulk to bilayer Ca(OH)$_2$, we see a reduction in either the
in-plane Young's modulus or the in-plane shear modulus, which are 50.7 N/m and 
19.16 N/m, respectively. The in-plane Poisson's ratio on the other hand is 
slightly increased to 0.32 and become more spongy-like as opposite to more 
cork-like character\cite{poisson}. In addition, the in-plane stiffness value of 
bilayer Ca(OH)$_{2}$ is calculated to be 55.6 J$/$m$^{2}$. 

We found that monolayer Ca(OH)$_2$ has a quite low in-plane Young's modulus 
(50.7 N/m) when compared to BN (278.2 N/m). The in-plane Poisson ratio (0.33) 
and the in-plane shear modulus (19.08 N/m) of the monolayer are similar with 
those for bilayer, and for BN, they are 0.22 and 113.5 N/m respectively. The 
calculated values of the in-plane stiffness of monolayer Ca(OH)$_{2}$ is 53.2 
J$/$m$^{2}$.

\caption{\label{fig:vib_caoh2} Phonon dispersion of monolayer Ca(OH)$_2$.}
\end{figure}

Lastly, for the analysis of the vibrational spectrum and further examination of 
the dynamical stability of monolayer Ca(OH)$_2$, we performed a 
calculation of the phonon spectrum using both the first-principles small 
displacement methodology (SDM)\cite{alfe} and density functional perturbation 
methodology (DFPT)\cite{baroni}. Here the non-quadratic dispersion of the 
flexural mode around the zone center is directly related to the insufficient 
FFT grid along the vacuum direction. It is seen from \autoref{fig:vib_caoh2} that 
similar to the Raman shift measurements observed from the bulk crystal 
structure, monolayer material has also high-frequency OH stretching 
modes at 3700-3800 cm$^{-1}$. 

Further analysis of the analysis of phonon 
branches shows that the decomposition of the vibration representation of optical 
modes at the zone center is $\Gamma = 4E_{u} + 2A_{2u} + 4E_{g} + 2A_{1g}$. As 
shown in right panel of \autoref{fig:vib_caoh2} there are four Raman-active phonon 
branches around 240, 350, 390 and 3700-3800 cm$^{-1}$. It is also worth to note 
that differing from other TMD structures having 1T phase, presence of H atoms 
results in existence of two different $E_{g}$ and $A_{1g}$ modes. Here the 
phonon dispersion having real eigenfrequencies in the whole Brillouin Zone, 
which is another indication of the stability of monolayer Ca(OH)$_2$.

\subsubsection{summary }\label{disc}

By performing first principle calculations on bulk, bilayer and 
monolayer Ca(OH)$_2$ and experimental confirmation of the bulk crystal 
layered structure, we have predicted several important properties of this 
material and their stability. We found that: (i) Ca(OH)$_2$ crystals are 
environmentally stable and their stable structures can be synthesized by 
experimental methods; (ii) Experimentally, we also demonstrated that Ca(OH)$_2$ 
crystals can be grown in layered form and also be exfoliated on arbitrary 
substrates; (iii) The dimensionality of Ca(OH)$_2$ will not change the 
electronic, structural and magnetic properties qualitatively, nevertheless 
intrinsic mechanical stiffness of each layer will become slightly stiffer as 
the system go from monolayer to bilayer. (iv) Interlayer interaction is mainly 
van der Waals dispersion-type force, and
the strength of the interaction is stronger than that of similar layered
materials (e.g MoS$_2$ and graphite). (v) The 
conduction states which have a free-electron-like character may be utilized for 
high-mobility electron transfer. 

We believe that the stable structure and the unique electronic properties of ultra-thin 
Ca(OH)$_2$, predicted for the first time here, will trigger interest in this 
new class of materials. 

\subsection[Few-layer of pentasilicene]{Few-layer of pentasilicene \footcite[This work is published in:][]{Aierken2016.pentasilicene}}

\subsubsection{Introduction\label{intro}}

Recently, a new 2D structure for carbon was proposed, called penta-graphene\cite{Zhang2015}. This crystal is composed entirely of pentagonal rings of C atoms with mixed sp$^2$/sp$^3$ orbital hybridization.  However, the silicon counterpart of this structure, penta-silicene, contains a dynamical instability in its monolayer form. A few attempts have been made to stabilize this new Si structure by hydrogenation\cite{Ding2015} and chemical doping\cite{Li2015b}. 

In the present work, we construct multilayer structures of penta-silicene. We use density functional theory to explore their stability and physical properties. Two types of stacking for the penta-silicene layers are found to give stable few-layer structures. These different stacking types lead to completely different electronic properties since one leads to metallic and the other to semiconducting behavior. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that bilayer penta-silicene has lower formation energy than the most stable hexagonal silicene bilayers. Furthermore, we found that the band gaps of these semiconducting penta-silicene bilayers can be tuned by mechanical strain. We first explore the stability of monolayer penta-silicene and demonstrate its dynamical instability. This forms the motivation to study few-layer systems. Then we investigate different stacking possibilities and the resulting stability. Further, we study their mechanical properties by calculating their elastic constants.  We also compare bilayer penta-silicene to the most stable bilayer hexagonal silicene structures. Lastly, The electronic properties of multilayered penta-silicene are discussed.

\subsubsection{Monolayer pentasilicene}\label{mono}

\caption{(a) Side view and (b) top view of the atomic structure, (c) phonon spectrum and (d) two vibration modes with imaginary frequency of monolayer penta-silicene. Visualization of vibration modes is done with the V\_Sim package \cite{VSim}. \label{fig:ps_monolayer}}
\end{figure}

The layer group symmetry of monolayer penta-silicene (p-Si) is p$\overline{4}$2$_1$m (58). As shown in \autoref{fig:ps_monolayer}(a) and \autoref{fig:ps_monolayer}(b), the primitive cell contains six silicon atoms, of which two have fourfold coordination (Si4) and four have threefold coordination (Si3). Two of the Si3 atoms reside above the Si4 atoms, denoted as Si3\_u, while the other two are below the Si4 atoms, denoted as Si3\_d. The Si4 atoms are bonded to four Si3 atoms while the Si3 atoms are connected to two Si4 atoms and one neighboring Si3 atom. Note that the two Si4 atoms have equivalent environments which are rotated by approximately 41$^{\circ}$ with respect to each other. Therefore, in analogy to graphene, we can relate these two equivalent Si4 atoms to sublattices which in the following will be referred to as the A and B sublattice.

The dynamical stability of this structure can be studied through its phonon spectrum. As noted before\cite{Ding2015,Li2015b} the phonon spectrum of monolayer p-Si contains imaginary frequencies as shown in \autoref{fig:ps_monolayer}(c), which is a clear signature of its instability. The corresponding atomic vibrations of the two imaginary frequencies at the $\Gamma$ point are shown in \autoref{fig:ps_monolayer}(d). These modes correspond mainly to out-of-plane vibrations of the Si3 atoms with respect to the Si4 atoms. As a consequence, the structure is found to fall apart, indicating that there is no stable form of monolayer p-Si. However, the addition of extra layers could reduce these out of plane vibrations and stabilize the structure. This is the motivation to study few-layer p-Si.

When considering two layers, different stacking configurations are possible. Here we focus on the so-called AA and AB stacking modes of the aforementioned sublattices (see \autoref{fig:ps_stackings}). The stacking in which both layers have the same in-plane orientation and the Si atoms are put right on top of each other is called AA stacking. AB stacking arises by shifting the A sublattice of one layer to the B sublattice of the other. This nomenclature was also used by \citet{Wang2015} for bilayer penta-graphene. Although penta-silicene has a tertragonal lattice symmetry, the highest proper rotational symmetry order is two. Therefore, there are also two different possible orientations of the upper layer with respect to the lower one:  One in which the two layers have the same orientation and another in which one layer is rotated over 90$^{\circ}$ with respect to the other one. We denote this last orientation with a subscript $r$ to show that it results from a 90$^{\circ}$ rotation, e.g. AA$_r$. Therefore, there are four possible stacking types for bilayer p-Si. Note that AB$_r$ stacking corresponds to the recently proposed bulk T12 phase for group IVA elements\cite{Zhisheng2012}. However, as discussed in more detail below, perfect AB$_r$ stacking is not stable in the case of multilayer penta-silicene.  A considerable distortion of the outer layers is required to stabilize AB$_r$ stacking. The distorted structure, which will be referred to as AB$_r^d$ in the following, is obtained by breaking the symmetry between the two Si3 atoms at each surface side in AB$_r$ multilayers. In this way, one of the two Si3 atoms acquires sp$^2$ hybridization and looses an electron to the other Si3 atom that has sp$^3$ hybridization.

\end{figure}

In \autoref{bilayer_table}, we compare the energies of the different stacking modes. In all cases the Si4 atoms are not involved in interlayer bonding since their possible number of bonds is already saturated.  Except for the AA stacking where all Si3 atoms are bound to Si3 atoms from the other layer, only half of the Si3 atoms are bonded to the other layer in the other cases. In \autoref{bilayer_table}, the size of the interlayer binding energy and the strength per bond are given. The size of the bond energies indicate strong chemical bonding. The  AB$_r^d$ stacking mode clearly forms the most stable structure. For the rest of the paper, we will only focus on the most stable AA and AB-type stacking, i.e. AA and AB$_r^d$.

We also investigated the stability of trilayer, tetralayer and bulk p-Si structures by adding extra layers to the stable bilayers mentioned above, their structures are shown in \autoref{fig:ps_AA_structures} and \autoref{fig:ps_AB_structures}. We list their structural and energetic properties in \autoref{few-layer-table}. Extra layers increase the cohesive energy per atom due to a smaller ratio of surface atoms. For AA stacking, adding a 4th layer to a trilayer system results in a double bilayer system with lesser bonding between them. Going to AA bulk, the interlayer interaction appears to be further reduced and the buckled layers become more flat. Adding extra layers to an AB$_r^d$ bilayer results in similar structures in which the Si3 atoms of the surface layers become distorted. For bulk, the undistorted AB$_r$ structure is found in which $\overline{4}$-fold symmetry is restored.



\subsubsection{Stabilities}\label{stab}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{ps_phonon_spectrum.eps}%
\caption{Phonon spectra of different-stacked few-layer p-Si. \label{fig:ps_phonon}}
\end{figure}

In this section we investigate the stability of the different multilayer structures discussed above.
Phonon calculations for the AA and AB$_r$ stacking modes reveal that only the AA bilayer is dynamically stable at low temperature. The extra bonds of the Si3 atoms in AA-stacked structures effectively reduce out-of-plane vibrations and stabilize the structure. Although the AA-stacked bulk structure has weaker interlayer bonding, its phonon spectrum contains no imaginary frequencies, indicating its dynamical stability. The AB$_r$-stacked layers, on the other hand, exhibit similar out-of-plane vibrations of the outermost Si atoms as a monolayer. For AB$_r^d$-stacking the distortion of the outermost layer removes the instabilities from the phonon spectrum, so that these structures are also dynamically stable. 

It is also interesting to see whether these structures remain stable at finite temperature. To this end, we performed \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics calculations at a temperature of 100 K. The evolution of the cohesive energy as a function of simulation time is shown in \autoref{fig:ps_MD}. For comparison, the results for the dynamically unstable monolayer are also shown. The monolayer laterally shrinks and becomes a disordered multilayered system. The AA and AB$_r^d$ bilayer systems, on the other hand, remain stable and retain their crystalline structure.

\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{ps_ab_initio_MD_100K.eps}%
\caption{The cohesive energy of monolayer and AA and AB$_r^d$ stacked bilayer p-Si as a function of time at a temperature of 100 K under NpT-ensemble. \label{fig:ps_MD}}
\end{figure}

As a final stability check, we investigate the mechanical stability of bilayer p-Si which is determined by the elastic constants of the structures. If the elastic constants satisfy the necessary and sufficient Born criteria generalized by \citet{Mouhat2014}, the structures are mechanically stable. AA bilayer p-Si belong to the layer group symmetry of p$\overline{4}$2$_1$m, which belongs to the tetragonal symmetry groups, and the independent elastic constants in 2D are: $C_{11}$= 101.43 N/m, $C_{12}$= 36.36 N/m and $C_{66}$ = 39.53  N/m. In the case of AB$_r^d$ bilayer p-Si, the crystal possesses pb2b or pm2a layer group symmetry which belongs to the orthorhombic crystal systems, and the independent elastic constants are: $C_{11}$=$C_{22}$= 63.83 N/m, $C_{12}$=26.92 N/m and $C_{66}$ = 50.43 N/m.  For mechanical stability, the following criteria must be fulfilled for 2D tetragonal systems:
\begin{equation}
C_{11}>|C_{12}|, C_{66}>0,
\end{equation}
while 2D orthorhombic systems should satisfy:
\begin{equation}
C_{11}>0,C_{11}C_{22}>C_{12}^2, C_{66}>0.
\end{equation}
As one can see, these criteria are satisfied by AA and AB$_r^d$ bilayer p-Si which ensures their mechanical stability. Additionally, in \autoref{mechanical}, we list the  (2D) Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio of bilayer p-Si systems. An interesting aspect of the possion's ratio of AB$_r^d$ is that it is quite high and close to the theoretical limit of 0.5. This means that this 2D material, prefers to change its shape rather than its surface area under strain, similar to the (3D) cases of rubber and water.

\subsubsection{Relative phase stability}\label{hexa}

In this section we compare the cohesive energy of bilayer p-Si to the more familiar bilayer hexagonal silicene structures (h-Si).  We examined 3 different stacking types for h-Si bilayers, denoted as h-Si1, h-Si2, and h-Si3. To the best of our knowledge, these are the most stable hexagonal bilayer structures of silicene predicted so far. The h-Si2 structure corresponds to the re-DL-Si structure suggested by \citet{Morishita2011} and the h-Si3 is the hex-OR-2$\times$2 structure that was recently proposed by \citet{Sakai2015}. These structures are constructed from the structure information provided by the authors in the supplementary material of the corresponding papers and re-optimized with our computational procedure. The h-Si1 is a new stable bilayer h-Si structure that we discovered (see ESI\dag~for details). It is composed of two planar, non-buckled, compressed hexagonal silicene planes that are shifted along the crystal plane. This structure is interesting because although its cohesive energy is close to the former two cases, it has a non-buckled nature. To the best of our knowledge, it is the most stable non-buckled bilayer silicene discovered so far. 

The cohesive energies of all the stable bilayer Si systems are given in \autoref{h-Si_table}. It is seen that the AB$_r^d$ bilayer p-Si system has the lowest energy, about 10 meV/atom less than the most stable hexagonal silicene bilayer h-Si3.  This means that the AB$_r^d$ p-Si structure is the most stable bilayer silicon structure predicted so far, which is a very surprising result. The AA-stacked p-Si has slightly higher energy than h-Si2 and h-Si3.

\end{figure}

In the last part of this work, we investigate the electronic properties of few-layer and bulk p-Si. These electronic properties are mainly determined by the electronic spectrum. In \autoref{fig:AA_bands} and \autoref{fig:AB_bands}, the electronic band structure of respectively AA and AB$_r^d$ p-Si multilayers and their bulk counterpart is shown. The band structure of the unstable monolayer is also calculated for comparison. Monolayer p-Si is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 0.046 eV (PBE). The band-edge states are mainly composed of $p_z$ orbitals of Si3 atoms. In contrast to this, all AA-stacked multilayers are metallic. In the case of the AB$_r^d$ structure, the semiconducting properties of monolayer p-Si are preserved, but the band gap changes somewhat with the number of layers. This can be understood from the position of the electron and hole states which correspond to the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM), respectively. As seen in \autoref{fig:AB_bands}, the VBM and CBM states are always localized on the outermost layers. In other words, the electronic properties are mainly determined by the surface region which is nearly independent of the slab thickness. For AB$_r$-stacked bulk p-Si, there is no surface and the VBM and CBM correspond to bulk states. This explains the much larger band gap (1.33 eV) in the bulk case. 


\subsubsection{Summary\label{conc}}

In this work, we proposed several stable structures for few-layer pentasilicene. The stability of these structures was confirmed via their phonon spectrum, finite-temperature molecular dynamics, and their mechanical properties. The type of stacking mode, AA or AB, of few-layer pentasilicene has a crucial influence on the electronic properties: AA-stacked systems are metallic, while AB$_r^d$ stacked ones are semiconducting . Surprisingly, the AB$_r^d$ stacked bilayer pentasilicene has lower energy than the most stable bilayer hexagonal silicene structures, which makes it the most stable predicted form of bilayer silicon.  


\section{Mechanical strain}

\subsection[Strain modulation of band gap of pentasilicene]{Strain modulation of band gap of pentasilicene \footcite[This work is published in:][]{Aierken2016.pentasilicene}}


Strain is an effective tool to modulate the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors. Here we investigate the band gap variation of AB$_r^d$ bilayer p-Si with respect to both uniaxial and biaxial tensile strain up to 10\% , see \autoref{fig:St_Eg}(a). We observe, in both cases, a small kink in the band gaps that gives rise to non-monotonic behavior. For uniaxial strain, the band gap first increases from 0.12 eV to 0.27 eV at 4\% strain, and then decreases again until the system becomes metallic at 10\%. A similar behavior is found for biaxial strain where the band gap increases up to 0.25 eV at 2\% strain and the system becomes metallic at 6\%  tensile strain. In order to explain the kink in the band gap evolution, we plot the relevant band edges with respect to the vacuum level as a function of strain. In the figure, the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone where the edges are located are given between round brackets, while the notation VBM-1 is used to denote the first band below the VBM (in the band structure without strain). As can be seen from \autoref{fig:St_Eg}(b) and (c), while the CBM($\Sigma$)s slightly decrease in a monotonic way, the VBM(M) crosses the VBM-1(M) once under uniaxial strain, and two crosses, first the VBM(M) switches its position from M to Y, and then back to M but for a lower band, occur for biaxial strain. These crosses give rise to abrupt changes in the band gaps.

\caption{Band gaps (a) and band edges for uniaxially (b) and biaxially (c) strained AB$_r^d$ bilayer p-Si.\label{fig:St_Eg}}
\end{figure}

We found that it is possible to engineer the electronic properties by tensile strain. Both quantitative and qualitative changes can be induced in this way. We explained the variation of the band gap from the band edge crossings that occur under strain. In conclusion, the proposed bilayer pentasilicene structure is the most stable form of bilayer silicon predicted so far and it was shown to have interesting tunable properties. 

\subsection[Variation of vibrational modes under strain in phosphorene]{Variation of vibrational modes under strain in phosphorene \footcite[This work is published in:][]{Aierken2015.thermalP}}

In \autoref{sec:pho_phos} we calculated the phonon dispersion of black and blue phosphorene, here we will discuss how the vibrational modes change with strain. In \autoref{fig:ire_phos} we revisit the phonon dispersion of phosphorene, here the $\Gamma$ point vibrational modes with their irreducible representations and their frequencies are given.

\caption{ (Color online) Variation of the $\Gamma$ frequencies with strain: (a) zigzag and (b) armchair direction of black P and (c) blue P.  \label{fig:shift_phos} }
\end{figure}

With the knowledge of the space group and its character table it is possible to assign vibrational modes to each band at the $\Gamma$-point. A table of all optical modes together with its frequency and irreducible representation for both structures is presented in \autoref{fig:ire_phos}(c) for the strainless structures. In \autoref{fig:shift_phos}, we show the variation of these optical phonons at the $\Gamma$ point under uniaxial strain. Our calculations agree well with the results of Ref.~\cite{phonon-blackP-1}. The frequency shift by strain can be directly detected using Raman spectroscopy. 
Depending on the atomic motion of the modes, the magnitude and type of strain, we find that the dependence of the phonon frequency can be different for each mode. Especially, the higher energy optical modes under uniaxial strain, applied along the zigzag direction, exhibit a much larger variation, see \autoref{fig:shift_phos}(a). B$^2_{3g}$ mode of black P has a different behavior under tensile and compressive strains along the zigzag direction. Applying a tensile (compressive) strain increases (decreases) the frequency of B$^2_{3g}$ mode. The frequency spacing between A$^2_{g}$ and B$_{2u}$ modes decreases when black P is stretched along both zigzag and armchair directions. While  the frequency of A$^2_{g}$ mode exhibits almost no variation under strain applied along the armchair direction,  it significantly varies under  strain applied along the zigzag direction.
Among the low lying optical modes (i.e., B$_{1u}$, B$_{1g}$ and B$^1_{3g}$), the B$_{1u}$ mode exhibits a larger variation with applied strain. 
E$_g$ and A$_{1g}$ modes of blue P always are red shifted when changing strain from compressive to tensile. Our results show that by measuring the frequency shift in the particular modes, it is possible to determine the
strain distribution in phosphorene.  

Our results show that the frequency shift observed in particular modes can be utilized to determine strain distribution in phosphorene.

%\subsection{Monolayer TiS$_3$}
%
%Bulk TiS$_3$ has a layered structure that makes it possible to exfoliate its monolayer. Indeed, such a process has been carried out by \citet{ADOM:ADOM201400043,ADMA:ADMA201405632} and results in the successful synthesis of a new type of 2D materials: monolayer TiS$_3$. The atomic structure of TiS$_3$ monolayer is shown in Fig.~\ref{structure}. The unit cell has a monoclinic crystal structure. The calculated lattice constants  are \textit{a} =  5.03 ~{\AA} and \textit{b} = 3.41~{\AA}, in good agreement with previous calculations \cite{Kang2015,Jin2015} and close to the experimental values for the bulk structure ($a$=4.958, $b$=3.401)\cite{Furuseth1975}. The monolayer is composed of connecting quasi-one-dimensional chains of TiS$_3$ triangular prisms extending along the \textit{b} direction, as shown in Fig.~\ref{structure}. One can spot a significant structural anisotropy in the system along the chain direction (green vector) and  the perpendicular direction (red vector).

\subsection[Magnetic properties modulation in penta-hexa-graphnene with strain]{Magnetic properties modulation in penta-hexa-graphnene with strain \footcite[This work is published in:][]{Aierken2016.magnetism}}

This new material has an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state which transforms to a ferromagnetic (FM) state under strain. The latter state is protected by a small strain-induced energy barrier. These findings can initiate further research to induce magnetism and spin-flip barriers through strain in other metal-free 2D materials.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{FM_AFM.eps}%   
\caption{AFM to FM transition of monolayer ph-graphene under strain. \label{transition}}
\end{figure}

Strain is an effective way to modulate the electronic properties of materials. \textcolor{red}{There are different ways to induce strain on 2D materials. \citet{Roldan2015} gave a comprehensive review on the strain engineering on 2D system both from experimental and theoretical view. }Here, we apply biaxial strain to our structure and monitor how the total energy of the different magnetic phases change, see \autoref{transition}. We find that an AFM to FM transition occurs for both compressive and tensile strains of approximately 6\% and 8\%, respectively. Therefore, strained structures of this kind can give a FM ground state, which is more beneficial for applications. The variation of the band gap under strain is plotted in \autoref{bandgap}. Both the FM and the AFM band gap has a similar qualitative behavior with a small quantitative difference between the two magnetic phases. The tensile strain decreases the band gap monotonically up to 10\%, while the compressive strain gives a non-monotonic behavior due to band crossings. From -5\% to 10\% strain, CBM and VBM are located at the $\Gamma$ and K high symmetric k-points, respectively. While two transitions of the location of the VBM happen below -5\% strain. First, it is shifted to the $\Gamma$ k-point from the second highest valence band around -8\%, and then shifted to the $\Sigma$ k-path between the $\Gamma$ and M k-points at -9\%.

\caption{ (Color online) AFM to FM transition through spin-flip in monolayer ph-graphene. \label{spinflip} }
\end{figure}

As a final property of the two different magnetic ground states, we study the energy barrier for the transition from the FM to AFM state through spin flipping. This calculation is realized by constraining the magnetic moment through a penalty contribution to the total energy in VASP, and rotate one of the moments stepwise through 180$^{\circ}$.  In this way an energy profile from FM to AFM can be obtained (see \autoref{spinflip}). The rotation of the magnetic moment was carried along two different planes, one along the zigzag direction and the other along armchair direction, but the difference of the energy profile is negligible. Without strain, there is almost no energy barrier for the transition from the FM to AFM state. However, if the structure is under a 9\% tensile strain, in which case the FM state is the ground state, an energy barrier of about 13 meV per magnetic atom arises to return to the AFM state. This is much larger as one consider the energy barrier from the AFM to the FM under the same strain, which is about 3.3 meV per magnetic atom. \textcolor{red}{This calculation is performed with the aim to study the stability of each magnetic state, and the possibility to form paramagnetic state even without thermal mothion. We found both magnetic state is stable, and there is no tendency to form non-collinear magnetic moment orientation, and possibility of paramagnetic formation is small.}

We discovered a strain-driven magnetic ground state transition from AFM to FM around  6\% compressive strain and 8\% tensile strain. An energy profile with different angles between two local magnetic moments is calculated to study the energy barrier for the transition between FM and AFM. While an energy barrier of about 13 meV/(magnetic atom) protecting the AFM ground state in the pristine case; it is protecting the FM ground state when the system is under 9\% tensile strain.  

\section{Heterostructures}

Another way to explore the property land of materials is to combine different composites to form heterostructurse\cite{Geim_Grigorieva_2013,Liu2016b,Pomerantseva2017}. They can be composites made by materials with complementary characters and perform better than each of the material individually, or materials those give new phenomenon and promising properties only when act together.  Given the obvious structure anisotropic in 2D materials, there are two types of heterostructures: vertical or lateral, see for example \autoref{fig:ver-lat-stru}. The vertical heterostructures composed of stacks of different 2D materials. They are held together via what holds graphite layers together: van der Waals force. Thus, this type of construction is referred as van der Waals heterostructures.  On the other hand, lateral heterostructure\cite{Jena2014,Chhowalla2015} is made by joining the edges of different 2D materials and the connection is mostly made through strong bonding, e.g. covalent or ionic. For this case, all the new properties results from the interface. In this section, I will present one for each type of the heterostructure and explore one properties. Comparisons will be made to illustrate the advantage of choosing these materials over the homo-structure.

\subsection{Introduction}
Heterostructures are the essential components of a wide range of solid-state devices, such as transistors, solar cells, and sensors\cite{singh1993,agostini2011}. They are  fabricated by combining different type of materials, e.g. metal, semiconductor, and insulator. Therefore, the physical properties of the combined system are enhanced or become more controllable as compared to that of each material individually. These tailored properties are strongly related to the interface of two different materials where all interesting and new phenomenon occur. However, along with the emergence of nanostructured materials, dimensionality has become another major factor affecting the physical properties of materials and devices along with the interface. Thus, solid-state device fabrication with heterostructures based on low dimensional nanomaterials has attracted significant attention and a new research area in material design has been initiated where researchers are expecting unprecedented results, phenomenon and physics\cite{Gan2013,Wu2015c,DiBartolomeo2016}. Indeed, several advantages of two dimensional (2D) phase engineering over the three dimensional counterpart has already been demonstrated.\cite{Duerloo2015}

In low dimensional heterostructure device architectures, there are usually two types of interfaces connecting different materials: top contact (vertical) and edge contact (lateral)\cite{Allain2015}. In top contacts, an overlapping portion of two materials are glued together mainly via interlayer van der Waals (vdWs) interaction, while in edge contacts one dimensional edges of two materials are contacted with covalent bonds without overlapping. The van der Waals interaction in top contact introduces a potential gap between the two layers which electrons have to tunnel through, and resulting in higher resistance due to the reduced carrier transmission probability. Naturally, this resistance is much lower in edge contacts owing to the formation of covalent bonds that provides a path for carriers to travel across the interfaces\cite{Matsuda2010,Kang2014}. Recently, Eda \textit{et al.}  has discovered the coexistence of multi-phase MoS$_2$ that is a promising material for heterostructure device fabrication due to their natural metal-semiconductor-metal structure with clear edge contacts\cite{Eda2012}. Considering the distinct electronic nature of these phases, physical properties of these heterostructures\cite{Kappera2014,Fan2015} can be tuned by phase engineering and novel solid-state device architectures can be realized for several different future applications.

The same research group has synthesized two dimensional semiconducting heterostructure devices\cite{Huang2014,Zhang2015} by using metal contacts. As a result of their experimental analysis, they have particularly pointed out the vital importance of the geometry and electronic nature consistency between the metal contact and the heterostructure on the device performance\cite{Bai2013,Eda2012}. Considering this fact, Kappera \textit{et al.}\cite{Kappera2014} have locally induced 1T metallic phase of MoS$_2$ in the 1H semiconducting phase of it, and they measured that the edge resistance was lower than that of metal contacts by more than a factor of two. Subsequently, 1T$\mid$1H lateral heterostructure has been drawn peculiar attention as a promising contact structure having a higher carrier injection rate. Different arrangements of the interfaces between 1T and 1H phases was investigated through theoretical calculations\cite{Hu2015,Sivaraman2016} and the structure formed by the connection of armchair edges of 1T and 1H phases has been determined as an energetically more favorable configuration. However, in these calculations, the more stable metallic structure (1T$_d$), which arises with small distortion of 1T phase, was considered.

The present paper aims to investigate the electronic transport properties of MoS$_2$ multi-phase lateral junctions when the more stable metallic phase of MoS$_2$ ( i.e. 1T$_d$) acts as the contact, which is compared with the 1T phase. Further to this, the paper mainly focuses on the effect of doping on the electrical transport properties. In the results section, we first construct three junction models and calculate their transmission without external bias . Then we calculate the electronic properties for different level of doping.



\subsection{Computational details}
The presented first-principles calculations are based on density function theory as implemented in the Vienna $ab$ $initio$ Simulation Package (VASP) \cite{VASP1,VASP2,VASP3,VASP4}. A plane-wave basis set based on the projected augmented wave (PAW) method \cite{PAW1,PAW2} are used to describe the wave functions. The cutoff energy of the basis is set to 400 eV. Exchange-correlation interactions are treated with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) formulation \cite{GGA-PBE1,GGA-PBE2}. A 25$\times$25$\times$ 1 $k$-points mesh is used to sample the Brillouin-zone for monolayer structures of 1H, 1T and 1T$_d$ MoS$_2$ and a 9$\times$1$\times$1 $k$-points grid is used for the structures shown in Fig. \ref{structure-1t}. A vacuum space of 15 \AA~ is incorporated to avoid interaction between the periodic images. The energy convergence criterion for the self-consistent calculations is set to $10^{-5}$ eV, while the force convergence criterion for the ionic steps is set to $10^{-2}$ eV/\AA.

Electronic transport across the 1T$_d$/1T-MoS$_2\mid$1H-MoS$_2$ interfaces is calculated using the self-consistent non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) technique as implemented in TranSIESTA\cite{transiesta} which is interfaced with the SIESTA code.\cite{siesta} Double-zeta (plus polarization) numerical orbital basis sets are used for all atoms. We employed norm-conserving pseudo-potentials\cite{tm}, the GGA/PBE functional, and an energy cutoff for the real-space mesh of 250 Ry.  In order to get accurate transmission spectra, the 2D Brillouin zone normal to the transport direction is sampled by meshes composed of  100 $k$-points in the periodic direction. While the SIESTA code uses a localized basis set and norm-conserving pseudopotentials, the calculated lattice parameters for different phases of MoS$_2$ agree well with those obtained from the VASP  code. 


\subsection{Results}
The use of metallic TMDCs as metal electrodes are expected to offer a breakthrough in the semiconductor industry as they have negligible heat dissipation and therefore are energy efficient. Among metallic TMDCs, metallic phases of MoS$_2$ (1T- and 1T$_d$-MoS$_2$) have attracted a growing interest due to its smooth interface with  the semiconductor phase of MoS$_2$ (1H-MoS$_2$). 
However, 1H phase is thermodynamically more stable than both 1T and 1T$_d$ phases. Therefore, the stabilization of 1T and 1T$_d$  over 1H phase becomes an essential requirement for the successful experimental realization of device configurable structures such as 1T/T$_d$-MoS$_{2}\mid$1H-MoS$_2$. On the other hand, 1T MoS$_2$ is the meta-stable and undergoes a Peierls transition to a low-energy state 1T$_d$ (or distorted 1T) and thus, metal contacts with the 1T$_d$ structure are more stable than the one with the 1T phase. However, the MoS$_2$ 1T$_d$ phase retransforms to the 1H phase at room temperature. 
As far as the relative stability is considered, choosing 1T$_d$ as metal contact further stabilized the junction.
Therefore, understanding the effect of different physical mechanisms on the stability of multiple phases (H, T, T$_d$) of this material is of vital importance to develop a proper control on phase transitions. To this end we mainly focus on the effect of doping (either charge or atom) on the stability, electronic and transport properties of 1T/T$_d$-MoS$_2\mid$1H-MoS$_2$ interfaces.  For the 1T and 1H hexagonal unit cells, the optimized in-plane lattice constant is obtained as 3.18 {\AA} .  On the other hand, the optimized lattice constants are $a$=3.18 {\AA}  and  $b$=5.72 {\AA} for  the tetragonal 1T$_d$ unit cell. 
These values are in good agreement with previous calculations\cite{C5NR07715J}. It was previously discovered the coexistence of 1T$_d$ phase with other two phases indicating their experimental stabilities, yet it is also possible to  relax the 1T$_d$ phase to to 1T phase using external source, such as electron beam irradiation\cite{Eda2012}. 
In experiment, 1T and 1T$_d$ are indistinguishable, because the S atoms are the same in two cases, only the Mo form cluster which STM image is limited to differentiate.


In this work, we systematically investigate the electronic and transport properties of three different device architectures, called as $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$, denoted in Fig. \ref{structure-1t}.  In all device models, the semiconducting 1H-MoS$_2$ phase is sandwiched between two 1T$_d$ metal electrodes to create Schottky contacts at the interfaces. In the $\alpha$ structure, the metallic part consists of both 1T and 1T$_d$-MoS$_2$ phases. The size of metallic and semiconducting parts are larger than 20 {\AA} along the transport direction. The interface between the 1T$_d$-MoS2 and 1H-MoS$_2$ phases have either an armchair termination as in the case of   the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ structures, or a zigzag termination as in the case of the $\gamma$ structure in order to investigate the influence of the contact type on the calculated properties. We predict that the $\gamma$ structure significantly deviates from planar geometry after structural relaxation, see Fig. \ref{structure-1t}. To check whether such distortion is due to a calculation artifact, we started from a complete planar geometry and allowed both atomic coordinates and cell parameters relax to their equilibrium values (or lowest energy configuration). We observed that planar structure is not stable and structural relaxation brought back the original distorted structure. Indeed, such buckling or deviation from planar structure mainly restricts to the left interface, in line with a recent work that proposed a new crystal structure model for MoS$_2$\cite{C5NR07715J}.  Observed buckling helps to reduce repulsive interaction between S atoms at the left interface, thereby enhancing the stability of this interface.

\caption{\label{transport} The zero bias transmission spectra for (a) the $\alpha$-device, (b) the $\beta$ device, and (c) the $\gamma$-device. }
\end{figure}

The transmission spectra for all three  device models at zero bias are depicted in Fig.~\ref{transport}. In these plots, the Schottky barrier for holes (electrons) is defined as the difference between Fermi level and valence band maximum  (conduction band minimum) of the semiconductor 11HH phase of MoS$_2$. The first clear observation is that there is a large barrier height at the pristine interfaces and there is no transmission within an energy range of 1.8 eV around the Fermi level, corresponding to the band gap of 1H-MoS$_2$. The Schottky barrier heights for the $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ structures are predicted as 0.72,  0.80, and 0.63 eV for holes and 1.16, 0.99 and 1.19 eV for electrons, respectively. The estimated size of the scattering region along the transport direction is larger than 23 {\AA}, which is much smaller than the mean free path of electron in MoS$_2$\cite{mos2-trans} and therefore, the transport properties of these systems can be estimated with ballistic transport calculations. The $\beta$ structure has the largest transmission over the calculated energy range. The Mo atoms form a zigzag chain perpendicular to the interface (or along the transport direction) in the $\beta$ and also $\gamma$ structures which enhances the electrical transport in these systems. However, the non-symmetric Mo zigzag chain lying parallel  to the transport direction leads to scattering of electrons at the interface and gives rise to low transmission as compared to the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ structures. Similar anisotropic electron transport has also been  observed for ReS$_2$ where resistance is the lowest along the Re cluster direction\cite{doi:10.1021/acsnano.5b04851}. Comparing  the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ devices,  the coexistence of 1T and 1T$_d$ regions in the former device contributes to lowering of the transmission due to additional scattering at the 1T/1T$_d$ interface as compared to the latter device where we only have 1T$_d$ phase in the electrode region.

\end{figure}

We next turn to the calculations of the electronic properties as a function of doping.
The central part of 1H-MoS$_2$ as the least affected from interface formation is considered to predict the band gap and the position of the band edges with respect to the Fermi level. The calculated band gap value, 1.75 eV,  clearly indicates that the size of the 1H part is large enough to achieve the monolayer limit and eliminates the electrode-electrode interaction. 
In fact, the band gap of the pristine 1H-MoS$_2$ monolayer calculated with the same functional is around 1.7 eV. 
In line with the transport calculations, the Fermi level appears within the band gap of the central region of 1H-MoS$_2$. The calculated Schottky barriers are 0.75 eV for holes and 0.99 eV for electrons in the $\beta$ structure. In the following discussion, we mainly focus on the $\beta$ structure due to its better transport properties as compared to the  $\alpha$ and  $\gamma$ devices. Other device models also exhibit similar properties. Our results contradicts experimental findings in the sense that, in experiments, it was shown that 1T (or 1T$_d$)$\mid$1H-MoS$_2$ interfaces exhibit a superior performance over the 3D metal-MoS$_2$ interfaces. However, we predict large Schottky barriers which give rise to a large contact resistance. In order to shed light on this contradiction, we calculate the electronic properties of the $\beta$ structure as a function of electron doping.   First of all, the electron doping stabilizes the 1T$_d$ phase over the 1H-MoS$_2$ and prevents the structural phase transition to the semiconducting 1H-MoS$_2$ phase\cite{doi:10.1021/jp4076355}. Also, the electron doping decreases the Schottky barrier height for electrons at the interface, leading to the formation of $n$-type Schottky barrier. This is attributed to the increase of the density of electrons in the $d$-orbital of the metallic 1T$_d$ MoS$_2$ phase.  Figure \ref{sch-chg} shows the variation of the Schottky barrier as a function of the electron concentration. We find that the Schottky barrier already diminishes for electron concentration larger than 0.1 electron (per 1T$_d$ MoS$_2$ formula unit). The Fermi level rises about 1 eV when only 0.28 electron is placed on the 1T$_d$ part. The direct electron doping can be achieved by using electron beams in experiments or Li/Na adsorption on the metallic phase\cite{doi:10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01186,doi:10.1021/jp4076355} . Here, the considered alkali atoms donate their electron to the 1T$_d$ phase and enhance the stability and electronic properties of the metallic part\cite{doi:10.1021/jp4076355}. In addition, absorption of hydrogen atom on the 1T part of MoS$_2$ has been also shown to reduce the barrier at the interface of 1T-MoS$_2\mid$1H-MoS$_2$\cite{doi:10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b03999,doi:10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00986}. 

Another possible strategy to enhance stability of metallic phases and electrical conduction at the metal-semiconductor MoS$_2$ interface is to dope metallic phase with transition metal atoms. Most of the well known TMDCs are either in the 1H or 1T phase when in their ground state. However, the single layer ReS$_2$ has neither H nor T as ground state, it stabilizes in 1T$_d$ structure\cite{tongay-res2,res2-cakir}. Therefore, alloying MoS$_2$ with Re may stabilize the 1T$_d$ structure of MoS$_{2}$ and leads to $n$-type doping of the crystal as similarly proposed by Raffone \textit{et al.} for Sn doped 1T phase\cite{Raffone}.  Meanwhile, we have previously shown that doping of ReS$_2$ with Mo results in a $p$-type doping of ReS$_2$ monolayer\cite{res2-cakir}. Therefore, we investigate the effect of substitutional doping of Re at Mo sites of 1T$_d$-MoS$_2$ on the transport properties. Here, we also consider the group V element Ta since the pristine TaS$_2$ monolayer crystallizes in the 1T phase and results in  a $p$-type doped 1T$_d$ MoS$_{2}$ structure. Indeed, in a recent work, it was shown that distorted phase of MoS$_2$ becomes energetically stable over 1H phase when Re concentration exceeds 50\%\cite{doi:10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b10739}. In this work, we did not consider such large dopant concentrations because of two reasons. First of all, lattice mismatch between 1H-MoS$_2$ and doped 1T-MoS$_2$ phases can be kept minimal for small dopant concentrations. At large concentrations, the relaxation of cell parameters leads to artificial enlargement of lattice parameters of  1H-MoS$_2$.  Secondly, Re doped 1T$_d$-MoS$_2$ becomes a semiconductor. To show the effect of doping, we only considered concentrations smaller than 20\%.  In this work, we assumed that doping of 1T-MoS$_2$ with Re or Ta may avoid the structural transition to 1H phase due to, for instance, temperature effect.  Figure \ref{re-ta-bare-dos} shows the PDOS for the central part of 1H-MoS$_2$ for Re and Ta doped $\beta$ structure. In the case of Re doping, the Fermi level approaches the conduction band of 1H-MoS$_2$, accompanying a significant decrease in $n$-type Schottky barrier height. On the other hand Ta doping reduces the $p$-type Schottky barrier height as expected. For a concentration of 14\% (per electrode), the $n$-type Schottky barrier becomes 0.85 eV for Re and $p$-type Schottky barrier becomes 0.58 eV for Ta.

Since Re and Ta doping give rise to different electronic properties, we can design metal-semiconductor
junctions with different type of Schottky barrier heights (i.e. $n$- and -$p$ type) in the same device geometry. This allows us to design 
optical and photovoltaic applications. While a Re doped junction effectively blocks holes, Ta doped junction hampers the easy passage of electrons across the junction. In this device geometry, we can separate  photo-generated charge carriers for instance. Figure \ref{pn} shows the device model and projected density of states as a function of position in 1H-MoS$_2$. While the left electrode is doped with Re, the right electrode is alloyed with Ta.  The central part of 1H-MoS$_2$ clearly has a PDOS similar to free standing 1H-MoS$_2$ monolayer with a band gap of 1.75 eV.  However, we have different electronic properties in the right and left side of the central region.
Due to Re (Ta) doping, the left (right) part has a $n$ ($p$)-type Schottky barrier.  
The presence of 1T$_d$-1H MoS$_2$ interfaces develops mid-gap states that mainly come from the atoms in the
boundary region. The electronic properties gradually change from the metallic to the semiconductor when moving away from the interfaces.  For the atoms far away from the interface region (i.e. central region of 1H-MoS$_2$), we observe a clear band gap which is close to that of pristine 1H-MoS$_2$. While the mid-gap states appear below the Fermi level at the left interface (Re-doped side), they are unoccupied and reside above the Fermi level at the right interface (Ta-doped side).  About 3.2 {\AA} from the interface, the mid-gap states start to disappear.  

Figure \ref{potential} shows the electrostatic potential along the heterojunction. We consider both pristine and doped $\beta$-devices. 
For undoped heterojunction, the average potential is symmetric at the left and right interfaces.
However, doped heterojunction has a  different electrostatic potential, especially, within 1H-MoS$_2$. 
Due to its valence configuration, Re (Ta) acts as a donor (an acceptor). 
This is reflected in the average effective potential shown in Fig.~\ref{potential}(b).
The average electrostatic potential (EP) does not have a sharp variation at the 1T$_d$-1H interface, extending along the 2-3 atomic rows.  
This is due to fact that we form interfaces between two different crystal structures of MoS$_2$ (i.e 1T$_d$ and 1H). EP converges to  the same value at the left and right electrodes. 
If one considers a photovoltaic device using the  $\beta$ structure co-doped with Re and Ta, 
an electron-hole pair is generated after absorbing a photon in the 1H part. 
Re-doped interface has a higher potential as compared to Ta-doped interface, producing a driving force for dissociation of the electron-hole pair. 
The electron flows along the potential decline (i.e. towards Ta-doped electrode)
and the hole in the opposite direction (i.e. towards Re-doped electrode).
In this way,  a photocurrent can be  generated by the photovoltaic effect. Thus, by proper control of doping and interface roughness, we 
can control the quantum efficiency of electron-hole dissociation\cite{doi:10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b00518}.

\subsection{Conclusion}
In this work, we explored the impact of doping on the electronic and charge transport properties across the 1T$_d$-1H MoS$_2$ interfaces by considering various device models. 
Doping and alloying (with charge, atom or molecule) 
appear as an effective method to tailor and improve the physical-chemical properties and stabilities of not 
only 1T/1T$_d$ phases of MoS$_2$ but also other 2D materials. 
The interface structure between 1T$_d$ and 1H phases is one of the decisive factors in the determination of the electrical transport across the heterojunction. 
We found that the Schottky barrier height of electrons for  pristine heterojunctions  can even disappear as a result of electron doping. 
While charge doping only reduces the Schottky barrier for electrons, co-doping is able to tune the barriers for
hole and electrons at the same time.
