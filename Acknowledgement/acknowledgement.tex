I would like to express my utmost gratitude to Professor Francois Peeters for giving me the opportunity to work in the condensed matter theory (CMT) group at the University of Antwerp. I truly appreciate both of his academical and financial support during my PhD study, without which this thesis would not have been completed. I would like to thank Dr. Ortwin Leenaerts and Dr. Deniz Çakır for their guidance in various of the practical aspect of the works. I have learned a lot from their advanced expertises in the field of first-principles calculations. I would also like to thank all the professors, students and administrative staff in the CMT group for their help in every possible way during my PhD study. Finally, I would like to thank my family for being supportive all the time.
