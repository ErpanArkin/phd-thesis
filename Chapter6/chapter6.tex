\chapter{Sammary}

This thesis starts with an introduction to graphene and several early 2D materials such as functionalized graphene, group IV 2D materials and other 2D materials from layered materials. and their diverse physical properties. Inspired by these new materials and new properties, in the \autoref{chap:4} and \autoref{chap:5}, the main results of the thesis are presented. I have proposed several new 2D materials such as
