This and the next chapters will be the main results of the works that I have completed during my PhD study. I have reviewed some of the 2D materials' properties in the last chapter. They belongs to the basic property category. In this chapter, I will present my works on some of the advanced properties determinations, namely thermal properties, piezoelectric properties, carrier mobility, magnetic properties and Li battery related properties. In addition, along with these new properties I will also introduce several new 2D materials on which the property determination was carried. They are phosphorene, monolayer Titanium trisulfide, penta-hexa-graphene and MXenes. Each of these topics comes from one publication.
