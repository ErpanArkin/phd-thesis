In this and the next chapter, the main results of the thesis will be presented. In the \autoref{chap:1}, I have reviewed some of the early post-graphene 2D materials, and their physical properties in \autoref{chap:3}. As it has been defined, the properties discussed before belong to the basic property category. In this chapter, I will present my works on the determination of some of the advanced properties, namely thermal properties, piezoelectric properties, carrier mobility, magnetic properties and Li battery related properties. In addition, along with these new properties I will also introduce several new 2D materials on which the property determinations were carried out. They are phosphorene, monolayer Titanium trisulfide, penta-hexa-graphene and MXenes. Each of the sections below comes from one publication. 

\section[Thermal properties of black and blue phosphorene]{Thermal properties of black and blue phosphorene \footcite[This work is published in:][]{Aierken2015.thermalP} }


\subsection{Introduction}

Black phosphorene (black P) is a single atomic layer of layered material black phosphorus and has been successfully exfoliated \cite{Han2014,Li2014}. Similar to the multiphase structures in phosphorus, there have been at least six different possible stable two dimensional allotropes of phosphorene were proposed\cite{Zhu2014,Guan2014a,Wu2015}. This multi-phase nature is because that in contrast to the C atoms of graphene, the P atoms in phosphorene have $sp^3$-hybridized orbitals. This is mainly caused by the extra valence electron of P atom in comparison to carbon. Indeed, if this extra electron is placed in a $sp^2$-hybridized structure, they would occupy the energetically unfavourable (antibonding) $\pi^*$ band. However, with $sp^3$-hybridization, a $\sigma$-bond network can be formed with three $sp^3$ orbitals and the other $sp^3$ orbital is used to host the remaining electron pair. This leads to an essentially tetragonal coordination of the P atoms and results in a buckled nature of $sp^3$-hybridized sheets, see \autoref{fig:phos_struc} for the structures. The out-of-plane positions of the atoms in $sp^3$-hybridized sheets give rise to various possible structural phases which are absent in $sp^2$-hybridized systems. Among those, black P, also referred as the $\alpha$ phase, is the most stable allotrope. However, the cohesive energy of blue phosphorene (blue P), or the $\beta$ phase, is only a few meV higher than that of black P, while other crystal structures are much less favourable with energy at least by $\sim$ 80 meV/atom higher.

\end{figure}

Triggered by its realization, various physical properties of phosphorene have been explored. Electronically, black P is a semiconductor with a direct band gap at the $\Gamma$ point\cite{Zhu2014,deniz3}. Experimentally, photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy measured a quasi-particle band gap of 2.2 eV\cite{bp-ex-3}, which is larger than its bulk band gap, i.e. 0.31-0.33 eV\cite{Maruyama198199,Narita1983422}. Due to its electronic structure, black P has been proposed as a potential novel material in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics, especially in the infrared regime. High performance black P based transistors with a mobility up to 1000 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s and an on/off ratio up to 10$^4$ at room temperature have been reported\cite{Li2014,Han2014}. Similar to black P, blue P was predicted to be a semiconductor material with an indirect band gap around 2.00 eV\cite{Zhu2014}. Therefore, it can be potentially use for field-effect transistor applications. The high mobility and tunable finite band gap of phosphorene, among other promising properties\cite{Jain2015,Wei2014,Kou2014,Tahir2015,zhou2014}, make it an interesting new member of the 2D materials. Despite the mentioned studies that aimed to explore the physical properties of phosphorene, a more comprehensive knowledge of finite temperature effects on their properties haven't been reported. Given the fact that this knowledge could contribute to the acceleration in the progress towards its proposed applications, this study\cite{Aierken2015.thermalP} is urgently needed. To this end, here we explore the thermal properties of black p and blue p, their temperature-dependent lattice constant, thermal expansion coefficients, free energy and specific heat.

\subsection{Thermal expansion and quasi-harmonic approximation}

\begin{figure}[htbp!] 
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{anh_exp.eps}%
\caption{Schematic illustration of the relation between asymmetric interatomic potential and thermal expansion. }
\label{fig:anh_exp}
\end{figure}

The thermal expansion is the expansion of material's volume at finite temperature. As shown in \autoref{fig:anh_exp}, it is directly related to the asymmetric of interatomic potential where the equilibrium position shift towards the flatter side of the potential energy profile and stay far away from the steeper side as the temperature increases. In below we will see how we can include this anharmonic potential using an approximation. The thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha(T)$ are defined through the following formula: 
\begin{equation}
\alpha(T)=\frac{1}{a_0(T)}\frac{da_0(T)}{dT},
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the temperature, $a_0(T)$ is the equilibrium lattice parameter corresponding to the minimum of the Helmholtz free energy.

In order to describe the thermal expansion within DFT, one needs to go beyond the harmonic approximation that is used to calculate the phonon frequency as we discussed in \autoref{chap:3}. Harmonic approximation gives infinite thermal conductivity, infinite phonon lifetimes and temperature-independent vibrational and elastic properties, which are contradicted to experiment. Quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA)\cite{QHA1,QHA2,QHA3,Baroni39} is a way to include the approximated anharmonic effect through volume-dependent frequency within non-interacting phonons approximation. Although it is an implicitly inclusion of anharmonic effect, its dominant role in the thermal properties, that is two orders of magnitude larger than explicit anharmonic effect, make sure it can correctly describe the thermal properties up to melting point. Beyond this temperature, anharmonic effect will become important. QHA has been applied to a various compounds from semiconductors to metals and to Earth materials under extreme conditions\cite{QHA1,Grabowski2009,Karki2000} . In \autoref{fig:qha_gra}, the applications of QHA for graphite and graphene are shown. The agreement between experiment and QHA is good in a wide range of temperature up to 2000 K. Another interesting point is that the negative thermal expansion, where the $\alpha(T)$ is negative, is presented in both materials, especially, graphene persists such a feature up to 2000 K. This is a common character of layered materials where layers are weakly bonded. The origin of this related to the ZA mode in layered materials as discussed in \autoref{chap:3}. At low temperature, ZA mode will be excited and this out-of-plane vibration effectively shrinks the in-plane dimension of the materials thus gives negative thermal expansion.

\end{figure}

Equilibrium lattice constants at any temperature $a_0(T)$ are calculated by direct minimization of the Helmholtz free energy $F(a,T)$ with respect to its independent lattice vector, i.e. in this case, $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ for black P, and $\mathbf{a}$ for blue P. For the minimization process, $F(a,T)$ is obtained by fitting the discrete data points of $F({a_i,T})$ to the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state, where $i$ is the label for different lattice constants or equivalently different strains. The $F({a_i,T})$ is constructed from $\omega^i_{\mathbf{q},j}$ and $E[a_i]$ through the following formula\cite{QHA0,QHA1}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:free-enerji}
F({a_i,T}) = E[a_i]+\sum_{\mathbf{q},j}\frac{\hbar \omega^i_{\mathbf{q},j}}{2} +k_BT\sum_{\mathbf{q},j}\text{ln}\left( 1-\text{exp} \left[ -\frac{\hbar \omega^i_{\mathbf{q},j}}{k_BT} \right]\right).
\end{equation}
Here, $T$ is the temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $E[a_i]$ is the DFT ground state energy. $\omega^i_{\mathbf{q},j}$ is the phonon frequency at the q point $\mathbf{q}$ with band index $j$. 
The sums  run over all q points and all bands of the whole Brillouin zone. Since the structural instabilities arise especially for the armchair direction when under compressive strain values larger than 4\%,  the calculation of phonon dispersions for both structures are performed under small strains, namely $\pm$ 2\%,  in order to evaluate $\omega^i_{\mathbf{q},j}$ and $E[a_i]$. Considering two independent lattice vectors \textbf{a} and \textbf{b} of black P two uniaxial strains are applied for these directions. While for blue P, only biaxial strain is applied to keep its hexagonal symmetry unchanged. The whole calculation process was carried out using phonopy-qha script\cite{phonopy-qha}.

\subsection{Phonon modes and dispersion \label{sec:pho_phos}}

Different from a pure planar graphene, black P and blue P have a buckled non-planar structure due to the sp$^3$ hybridization, yet all three structures share the same hexagonal lattice base. Given an almost identical local environment in the unit cell, see \autoref{fig:phos_struc}, it is not surprising that blue P and black P having similar total energy. Only significant difference is the plane, marked as grey shown in \autoref{fig:phos_struc}, on which the system extends to form an infinite 2D crystal. Therefore, thermal expansion on these different planes are expected to be different and will carry insight information on the different finite temperature properties. The primitive unit cell of black P is a rectangular lattice with a four-atom basis and a space group of $D_{2h}^7$, and that of blue P is a hexagonal lattice with a two-atom basis and a space group of  $D_{3d}^3$. Therefore, besides the three acoustic modes with the in-phase vibrations of atoms, there are nine and three optical modes for black P and blue P, respectively. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{phos_phon.eps}%
\caption{Calculated phonon dispersions for prinstine (a) black and (b) blue P. (c) Optical phonon modes together with their frequencies (in units of cm$^{-1}$) at the $\Gamma$ point and irreducible representations for black P and blue P.\label{phos_phon}}
\end{figure}

The calculated phonon dispersions along the high symmetric q lines corresponding to these modes are depicted in \autoref{phos_phon}(a) and (b) for both structures. Parallel with the previous calculations~\cite{phonon-blackP,phonon-blackP-1}, the calculated phonon dispersions are free from imaginary frequencies, which ensures the structural stability of the materials. Lowest acoustic mode ZA displays a $q^2$ relation as we discussed in \autoref{chap:3}.  The other two acoustic modes LA and TA still have a linear dependence with respect to the $q$ wavevector since the situation is the same here as in the bulk. The total frequency range of the phonon dispersion is larger by an amount of about 100 cm$^{-1}$ in blue P as compared to black P. We will discuss more about the vibrational character of these phonon modes in the later chapters where we investigate the effect of strain on the frequency of the vibration.

\subsection{Temperature-dependent thermal properties}

The equilibrium lattice constants at zero K, $a_0$ and $b_0$ of black P and $a_0$ of blue P, are predicted as $a_0$ = 3.298 {\AA}, $b_0$=4.625 {\AA}, and  $a_0$ = 3.277 {\AA}, respectively,  in  good agreement with previously reported results ($a_0$ = 3.297 {\AA}, $b_0$=4.640 {\AA} for black P\cite{fei,deniz3}, and  $a_0$ = 3.330 {\AA} for blue P\cite{Zhu2014}). 
The expansion of these lattice parameters due to zero-point vibration is around 0.2\% at 0 K, which is smaller than that of other well-known two dimensional materials like graphene and $h$-BN, but it is comparable with that of MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$. This result is reasonable due to the difference in the maximum phonon frequency between these materials: that of graphene and $h$-BN is around 1600 cm$^{-1}$ and that of MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, black P and $a_0$ of blue P is around 600 cm$^{-1}$. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{(a) Lattice constants and (b) TEC as a function of temperature.  Here, ZZ and AC are denoted for the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively. (c) TEC of monolayer MoS$_2$ for comparison from Ref. \cite{QHA3}.\label{fig:tec}}
\end{figure}

The temperature dependence of the lattice constants $a_0(T)$, $b_0(T)$ and thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) $\alpha(T)$ of both structures are shown in \autoref{fig:tec}. Anisotropic nature of the structure of black P leads to different lattice constant expansion rates. A faster thermal expansion along the armchair direction (i.e. $\mathbf{b}$) is found, see \autoref{fig:tec}(a). While a small negative TEC appears for all structures in all directions at temperatures lower than 100 K, black P along the zigzag direction has a more apparent negative expansion.  The lattice constant of both phases varies linearly when T $>$ 200 K, see \autoref{fig:tec}(a). The TEC increases rapidly with temperature  up to 300 K.  After that, all TECs changes slowly with temperature starting from around 400 K in agreement with predictions for two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides~\cite{QHA2,QHA3}, for example see \autoref{fig:tec}(c) for monolayer MoS$_2$.
Different from MoS$_2$, we do not observe any saturation of the TEC for black P at high temperatures.  While black P expands at most 0.02 {\AA} along the zigzag direction as T approaches 1000 K, it expands 0.04 {\AA} along the armchair direction. As is clear from \autoref{fig:phos_struc}, an uniaxal expansion along the armchair direction may result in a structural phase transition from black P to blue P because of the similar hexagonal arrangement of P atoms\cite{negative-pos}.

Here, ZZ and AC are used for the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively. $\Delta F(T)$ is the difference between $F(T)$ of black P and blue P. The blue arrow  (b) denotes the transition point, after which blue P becomes thermodynamically more stable over black P.  The specific heat at constant pressure ($C_p$) and the difference ($\Delta C_p$) between $C_p$ of black P and blue P are shown in (c).  \label{energies_data}}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{energies_data}, the variation of the cohesive energy as a function of strain at 0 K (a) and the variation of the Helmholtz free energy (F(T)) as a function of temperature (b) are presented. In \autoref{energies_data}(b), 
we also show $\Delta F(T)$ which is defined as $\Delta F(T)$=$F_{blue P}(T)$ - $F_{black P}(T)$. Here, $F_{blue P}(T)$ and $F_{black P}(T)$ are the Helmholtz free energy of black P and blue P, respectively. As the zero-point energy continuously decreases with strain from minus to plus, the variation of the zero-point energy results in an asymmetric behaviour in cohesive energy with strain. In addition, the curvature of this total energy gives the in-plane stiffness of the material as a measure of the response to mechanical deformation. It is clear that blue P is a stiffer material as compared to black P.  Moreover, the deformation along the zigzag direction of black P is harder than that along the armchair direction at 0 K, and this is consistent with the finite temperature behaviour as we conclude from previous section in connection with \autoref{fig:tec}(a). 

The $F(T)$ decreases as temperature increases due to the entropy term (the last term in \autoref{eq:free-enerji}). Inclusion of the zero-point energy gives rise to a slightly higher ground state energy for blue P over black P since its optical phonon modes have larger frequencies. However, as temperature increases, a crossing of the free energy curves around 135 K occurs, which makes the blue P energetically more favorable at high temperatures, see \autoref{energies_data}(b). The free energy difference between the two phases is of the order of 4 meV at room temperature, meaning that the two phases can coexist. In addition, it is possible to observe a phase transition driven by temperature from black P to blue P or visa verse at T=135 K. 

In \autoref{energies_data}(c), we present constant pressure heat capacity, $C_p$, results for both structures, which is generally few percent differ from constant volume heat capacity in similar structures\cite{QHA1}. The $C_p$ difference ($\Delta C_p$) between two phases is significantly small for all temperature range as represented with blue dash dot line in \autoref{energies_data}(c), which states essentially very similar Debye temperature for these two different phases.  At high temperatures, C$_p$ approaches its classical value of 12 $k_B$.  When T=300 K, C$_p$ already reaches about 80 $\%$ of its classical value, meaning that the most of the phonon modes are activated at this temperature. 

\subsection{Summary}

In summary, we systematically investigate the lattice thermal properties of black and blue P. Similar to its electronic properties, black P has direction dependent mechanical and thermal properties. The calculated thermal expansion coefficients demonstrate that a much larger expansion along the armchair direction with temperature is observed for black P. While black P is thermodynamically more stable than blue P, the latter becomes more stable when T $>$ 135 K, yet their free energy difference is small due to their structural similarities. It is possible to observe a structural phase transition from black P to blue P by increasing temperature beyond 135 K, and therefore the coexistence of these two phases is possible. 

\section[Piezoelectric properties of 2D-TMDCs and 2D-TMDOs]{Piezoelectric properties of 2D-TMDCs and 2D-TMDOs \footcite[This work is published in:][]{Menderes2015}}

\subsection{Introduction}

We have seen the general properties of 2D-TMDs in \autoref{chap:1} and vibrational and electronic properties of their one member: 2D-MoS$_2$ in \autoref{chap:3}. When the S atom is replaced with O, TMDs become transition metal dioxides (TMDOs), whose monolayer have similar properties as 2D-TMDs. For the consistency, here in this section we refer to the 2D-TMDs as 2D-TMDCs. Although 2D-TMDOs proven to be stable, they have not been synthesis yet. Sharing similar electronic strucutre, 2D-TMDCs and 2D-TMDOs already demonstrating various of potential applications, such as nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices for their direct finite band gaps\cite{Jariwala2014,Wang2012}. In addition to these exciting applications, 2D-TMDCs in the noncentrosymmetric 2H crystal structure with $D_{3h}$ symmetry have also been shown to have remarkable piezoelectric properties that can be then use in pressure sensors,  transducers,  high voltage generators,  nar energy harvesters, energy conversion and piezotronic applications. Many layered materials have a centrosymmetry which suppresses the piezoelectricity. However, this symmetry will be broken when it searches the monolayer level, and then the piezoelectricity is recovered. For example, graphene preserves the centrosymmetry as in graphite, or inversion symmetry, due to its non-polar nature thus it does not display piezoelectricity; Whereas 2D-BN and 2D-TMDs break such symmetry and become noncentrosymmetric system where piezoelectric effect can manifest themselves. 

\citet{Duerloo2012} calculated the piezoelectric properties of single layer of BN, MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$, and WTe$_2$by using first principle calculations. They reported that piezoelectricity of the 2D-TMDC monolayers in H phase are comparable or even better than that of conventional bulk piezoelectric materials. \citet{Zhu2015} reported 
experimental evidence of piezoelectricity in free-standing MoS 2 and they found that this material exhibits piezoelectricity for an odd number of layers in which case inversion symmetry is broken. Their measured piezoelectric coefficient is 2.9$\times$10$^{-10}$ C/m, which agrees well with previous theoretical calculations\cite{Duerloo2012}.  Similarly, by using DFT based theoretical calculations, it has been predicted that group III monodichalcogenides, namely GaS, GaSe and InSe, have piezoelectric stress coefficients of 1.34$\times$10$^{-10}$, 1.34$\times$10$^{-10}$ and 1.47$\times$10$^{-10}$ C/m, respectively\cite{Li2015a}.  In addition, reducing the dimensionality has been shown to enhance piezoelectricity in ZnO\cite{Xiang2006}. These studies indicate that TMDCs are promising candidates as low dimensional piezoelectric materials. 

Since previous calculations and experiments were only focused on Mo and W based TMDs, the potential of other 2D-TMDCs and 2D-TMDOs for piezoelectric device applications have remained an open question so far. To reveal such potential, first principles calculations are performed in order to systematically investigate the piezoelectric properties of single layer 2H-MX$_2$ compounds, where M= Cr,  Mo, W, Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn and X=O, S, Se, Te.  Lattice parameters, atomic positions, electronic band-gap values, elastic stiffness constants ($C_{11}$ and $C_{12}$), Young modulus ($Y$), Poisson's ratios ($\nu$), piezoelectric stress coefficients ($e_{11}$) and piezoelectric strain coefficients ($d_{11}$) are calculated. 

\subsection{Piezoelectric constants}

Piezoelectricity is the ability of some materials to generate internal electric field in response to applied mechanical stress. Two types of piezoelectric phenomenons can be observed for piezoelectric materials: 1) direct piezoelectric effect: separation of opposite charge due to stress and 2) converse piezoelectric effect: occurrences of stress and strain under external electric field. In \autoref{fig:piezo}, the mechanism of direct piezoelectric effect is shown. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{piezo.png}%
\caption{Mechanism of direct piezoelectric effect\label{fig:piezo}. Image source: \cite{piezo_fig}}
\end{figure}

%To investigate the piezoelectric properties, we follow the same theoretical approach of Ref. \cite{Duerloo2012}. The piezoelectric tensor\cite{baroni,PhysRevB.72.035105}, $e_{ij}$, can be defined  in terms of the induced polarization in the  direction $i$ due to a strain ($\varepsilon_{j}$) change along the direction $j$ as follows
\begin{equation}
e_{ij}=\partial P_{i}/\partial\varepsilon_{j}=\partial P_{i}/\partial\varepsilon_{j}\mid_u+\sum_k (\partial P_{i}/\partial u_{ik})(\partial u_{ik}/\partial\varepsilon_{j}). \label{eq:equ1}
\end{equation}
where $P_i$ is the induced polarization along the direction $i$ as a result of an applied strain $\varepsilon_{j}$ along the direction $j$. 
The $P_i$ is calculated using the Berry Phase approach\cite{vanderbilt2000} as implemented in the VASP package with applied uniform strain, ranging from 0.01 \% to -0.01 \% in steps of 0.005 \%, along the armchair side of the rectangular cell. At this point, in order to apply strain in a desired direction, the hexagonal primitive cell structure of each material is transformed to a tetragonal one composed of two hexagonal primitive cells\cite{Duerloo2012}, see \autoref{fig:mx2_str}. The first term in \autoref{eq:equ1} is the clamped-ion or homogeneous strain contribution to the piezoelectric tensor and it mainly arises from the electronic contribution. The second term represents the contribution from the internal relaxation of ions. Here, $u_{ik}$ is the fractional coordinate of the $k^{th}$ atom along the $i$ direction of the unit cell. 

Since TMDCs and TMDOs compounds have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, the inclusion of internal relaxation becomes essential in order to obtain realistic piezoelectric properties. In addition, it is clear that the relaxed-ion piezoelectric coefficients are experimentally relevant quantities that can be measured. From the theoretical point of view, since the relaxed-ion piezoelectric coefficients include both electronic and relaxation effects, the calculation of the clamped-ion piezoelectric coefficients helps to separate the electronic and relaxation contributions from the relaxed-ion piezoelectric coefficients. The number of independent piezoelectric tensor coefficient is deduced from the symmetry of the crystal. For TMDCs and TMDOs, we only need to calculate the $e_{11}$ component of the piezoelectric stress tensor. $e_{11}$ relates in-plane strain to in-plane electrical polarization. The piezoelectric coefficient $e_{31}$ is zero due to the presence of an inversion centre between the two layers of chalcogenides. However, it is found to be non-zero for the unsymmetrical H and F co-decorated graphene\cite{Ong2013,KIM201462}. 

The corresponding piezoelectric strain tensor ($d_{11}$) of each material is predicted from the following relation\cite{Duerloo2012}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:d11}
                d_{11}= e_{11}/( C_{11} - C_{12} ).
\end{equation}
For each applied strain, the ions are kept in their strained positions or allowed to relax to their new equilibrium positions, and consequently the clamped-ion or relaxed-ion piezoelectric properties are calculated, respectively.

\subsection{Accurate band gaps from HSE06 hybrid functional}

It is mandatory that a piezoelectric material has to be an insulator or semiconductor with a sufficiently wide band gap to avoid current leakage. Thus, we first calculate the electronic properties of twenty eight single layer MX$_2$ compounds, where M= Cr,  Mo, W, Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn and X=O, S, Se, Te. We discard the metallic structures, namely SnSe$_2$, SnTe$_2$, and TiTe$_2$. Actually, G$_0$W$_0$ calculations predicted that 2H-TiTe$_2$ is a small band gap semiconductor material\cite{Rasmussen2015}. Since semi-local functionals are used in the Berry's phase calculations, 2H-TiTe$_2$ is excluded. For electronic structure calculations, we also applied the HSE06 hybrid functionals in order to obtain realistic electronic band gap values for TMDCs and TMDOs. \autoref{fig:bandgaps} shows the calculated PBE-GGA and HSE06 band gap values E$_{gap}$. The materials, except Cr, Mo, and W based TMDCs, have indirect band gaps and the predicted values and trends are in good agreement with previous theoretical calculations\cite{Duerloo2012,Ataca2012,Guo2014a}. Generally, the band gap increases when moving upwards in the chalcogens family from Te to S and with increasing atomic number in the transition metals. However, the latter trend is partially valid when the compounds with O are included. The difference is that within the same row of the transition metals, TMDOs with a larger atomic number tend to have smaller band gaps which is in contrast to the TMDCs case.

As previously mentioned, we need to calculate the elastic constants in order to obtain the piezoelectric strain, $d_{11}$ coefficients, see \autoref{eq:d11}. Therefore, the relaxed-ion and clamped-ion elastic stiffness coefficients (C$_{11}$ and C$_{12}$), Young modulus (Y= (C$_{11}^2$-C$_{12}^2$)/C$_{11}$) and Poisson's ratios ($\nu$=C$_{12}$/C$_{11}$ ) for all 2D-TMDC and 2D-TMDO materials considered in this study are obtained and are listed in \autoref{tab:elastic}. Our results are in good agreement with available data\cite{Peng2013,Kang2013,Duerloo2012,Cooper2013}. The first observation from \autoref{tab:elastic} is that C$_{11}$, C$_{12}$ and Y decreases with increase of the row number of the chalcogenide atom. Except Zr, in each chalcogenide group, the MX$_2$ monolayer becomes stiffer with increase of the row number of the metal atom. Structures considered in this study are found to be less stiff when compared to graphene (Y=341 N/m)\cite{QHA2} and single layer $h$-BN (Y=275.9 N/m)\cite{QHA2}. Also it should be noticed that the calculated elastic constants are positive and satisfy the Born stability criteria for crystals having hexagonal symmetry\cite{nye1985physical,Born1998}.  Note that the relaxed-ion elastic constants, i.e. C$_{11}$ and C$_{12}$, are always smaller than the clamped-ion ones since the internal relaxation of ions allows to release some of the stress in the former, see \autoref{tab:elastic}.

\caption{\label{fig:piezo_res}The calculated clamped and relaxed-ion (a) piezoelectric stress ($e_{11}$)  and (b) piezoelectric strain ($d_{11}$) coefficients.}
\end{figure}

Piezoelectric coefficients ($e_{11}$) are derived from the slope of the polarization change in \autoref{fig:polariz}) with applied uniform strain, ranging from 0.01 \% to -0.01 \% in steps of 0.005 \%, along the armchair side of the rectangular cell via Berry's Phase approximation\cite{vanderbilt2000}. The clamped-ion and relaxed-ion $d_{11}$ coefficients are obtained by using the calculated $e_{11}$ coefficients, and the elastic constants ($C_{11}$ and $C_{12}$) via \autoref{eq:d11}. \autoref{fig:piezo_res} shows the calculated $e_{11}$ and $d_{11}$ coefficients for both TMDCs and TMDOs. The materials are ordered along the $x$-axis by considering the period and group number of the transition metal element in the periodic table. The predicted relaxed-ion $e_{11}$ and $d_{11}$ coefficients are consistent with the available reference data\cite{Duerloo2012,crs2}, see results for Cr, Mo and W based TMDCs, which are comparable with the piezoelectric properties of single layer and bulk $h$-BN\cite{Duerloo2012,km-2009,km-2011a,km-2011b}. In addition, the relaxed-ion $e_{11}$ coefficient of single layer MoS$_{2}$ (4.91$\times$10$^{-10}$ C/m) is comparable with the experimentally measured piezoelectric coefficient of 2.90$\times$10$^{-10}$ C/m\cite{Zhu2015} and agrees  well  with the reported value of 3.64$\times$10$^{-10}$ C/m.\cite{Duerloo2012}. In addition, the trends found for the $e_{11}$ and $d_{11}$ coefficients of Mo and W based TMDCs are consistent with those found in Ref.\cite{Duerloo2012}. The difference between our calculated piezoelectric coefficients and previous calculations is likely due to the use of different pseudopotentials, small differences in elastic constants, and other computational parameters (for instance $k$-mesh).

SnS$_2$ has the highest $e_{11}$ coefficient for the relaxed-ion (10.7$\times$10$^{-10}$ C/m) calculation. WO$_2$ has the smallest relaxed-ion piezoelectric stress coefficient (2.49$\times$10$^{-10}$ C/m) among TMDOs and WTe$_2$ has the smallest clamped-ion piezoelectric stress coefficient (1.75$\times$10$^{-10}$ C/m). From \autoref{fig:piezo_res}, we predict several  periodic trends in clamped-ion $e_{11}$ and $d_{11}$ coefficients for TMDC and TMDO monolayers. The clamped-ion $e_{11}$ coefficients of TMDCs usually increase when moving from right to left in the periodic table (i.e., from CrX$_{2}$ to TiX$_{2}$) and upward in an individual group of both transition metal and chalcogen atoms.  This trend is nearly the same for TMDOs. However, for TMDCs, the trend (i.e., the increase in the calculated clamped-ion $e_{11}$ coefficients when moving upward in the group of chalcogen elements) becomes reversed for the relaxed-ion calculations of group VI elements  as clearly seen in \autoref{fig:piezo_res}(a). 
The clamped and relaxed ion $d_{11}$ coefficients increase when moving downward in the group of chalcogen elements (i.e. from S to Te) in each metal group.  This trend can be correlated to the polarizability of chalcogen atoms since the atoms are easily polarized when going downward in a specific group of the periodic table.  We notice that the chalcogenide atoms have a much larger impact on the $d_{11}$ coefficients as compared to the metal atoms.  Especially in group VI, the $d_{11}$ coefficient is maximized if one uses a smaller metal atom and a larger chalcogen atom. In group IV, Zr does not exhibit the same trend that is found for the group VI elements. This is partially because the C$_{11}$ elastic constant of Zr based TMDCs for a particular chalcogen atom is smaller that that of Ti and Hf based TMDCs. Since TMDOs pose larger elastic constants, they usually have smaller $d_{11}$ coefficients as compared to TMDCs. In other words, the stronger the material the smaller the $d_{11}$ coefficient.  

Among the group VI elements (i.e., Cr, Mo and W), Cr based TMDCs and TMDOs are found to have much better piezoelectric properties in each chalcogenide group and CrTe$_2$ possesses the largest relaxed-ion  $e_{11}$ (8.06$\times$10$^{-10}$ C/m) and $d_{11}$ (17.1 pm/V) coefficients. On the other hand, the relaxed-ion $e_{11}$ and $d_{11}$ coefficients of SnS$_{2}$ are  almost the same as those of CrTe$_2$. The predicted relaxed-ion $e_{11}$ values are much larger than the values previously predicted for surface decorated graphene structures\cite{Ong2012}. Furthermore, when the piezoelectric coefficients of the extensively used bulk piezoelectric materials, namely 2.3 pm/V for  $\alpha$-quartz\cite{Bechmann1958}, 3.1 pm/V for wurtzite GaN\cite{Lueng2000} and 5.1 pm/V for AlN\cite{Lueng2000}, are considered, we predict that TMDCs and TMDOs have comparable or even larger relaxed-ion piezoelectric coefficients.

\subsection{Importance of internal relaxation}

It is  essential to discuss the effect of the internal relaxation on the piezoelectric properties of TMDCs and TMDOs. Relaxing the ion positions after applying strain significantly reduces (increases) the polarization of the  Ti, Zr and Hf (Cr, Mo and W) based TMDCs. As a result, the clamped-ion piezoelectric coefficients of the Ti, Zr and Hf (Cr, Mo and W) based TMDCs monolayers are much larger (smaller) than that of the relaxed-ion coefficients. This means that the electronic contribution, i.e. the first term in \autoref{eq:equ1}, and strain contribution, i.e. the second term in \autoref{eq:equ1}, have opposite (the same) sign for the  Ti, Zr and Hf (Cr, Mo and W) based TMDCs.  The calculated elastic constants suggest that Ti, Zr and Hf based TMDCs are more brittle materials that are expected to exhibit larger response to an applied strain, thereby giving rise to higher clamped-ion piezoelectric constants.  For TMDOs, the contribution of internal relaxation to the $e_{11}$ coefficient decrease when moving downward in an individual metal group. 
However, in each chalcogen group, the internal relaxation becomes  generally less important when going from Te to S. This can be attributed to the large strain-induced ionic motion in response of an applied strain. 
In other words, after applying strain, the amount of the internal relaxation of the chalcogen atoms increases from S to Te, giving rise to a larger internal relaxation contribution to the piezoelectric coefficients in Te based TMDCs. 
Since Te is the most easily polarizable atom among the chalcogenide atoms (due to its larger size), the polarization effects (and hence electronic contribution to the  $e_{11}$ coefficient) are found to be large in Te based TMDCs  as compared to S and Se counterparts. However, the increase in piezoelectricity effects competes with the degradation of stability.

\subsection{Summary}

In summary, we presented a detailed theoretical investigation of the piezoelectric properties of semiconductor TMDC and TMDO monolayers. Our calculations show that TMDC and TMDO structures are strong candidates for future atomically thin piezoelectric applications.  We show that Ti,  Zr, Sn and Cr based TMDCs and TMDOs have much better piezoelectric properties as compared to Mo and W based 
TMDCs and TMDOs and the well-known conventional bulk piezoelectric materials.
The usage of these 2D piezoelectric materials in ultra sensitive sensors, low-power electronics and nanoscale electromechanical systems are expected to have an impact on the size reduction, weight and energy consumption of such devices. 

\section[Magnetic properties of penta-hexa-graphene]{Magnetic properties of penta-hexa-graphene \footcite[This work is published in:][]{Aierken2016.magnetism}}

\subsection{Introduction}

More and more novel two-dimensional (2D) crystal materials with distinct properties are predicted and synthesized. Especially, graphene\cite{Novoselov666,Geim2007} and its derivatives \cite{Vasilios2012,Inagaki2014} are under intensive research to either modify their known properties or to increase their functionality. Considering the very low spin-orbit coupling and long spin relaxation time in these systems, substantial effort has been devoted to the induction of magnetism in these metal-free materials with the aim for future spintronic devices\cite{KAN2008,Kun2015}. Intrinsic magnetism in graphene is absent, but extrinsic magnetism has been achieved by means of partial hydrogenation\cite{Zhou2009,Eng2013}, foreign atom substitution\cite{Okada2001,Miao2016} and the introduction of defects\cite{Pereira2006,Yazyev2007}. 

Three types of orbital hybridization are usually found in carbon allotropes, namely $sp$, $sp^2$ and $sp^3$.  While graphene is made of a network of $sp^2$ hybridized atoms connected through $\sigma$ and $\pi$ bonds of $p_z$ orbitals, diamond is exclusively held together by $\sigma$ bonds between $sp^3$ bonded atoms. Another class of carbon allotropes is formed by the graphynes and graphdiynes\cite{Baughman1987,Ivanovskii20131}. These flat materials contain a mixture of $sp$ and $sp^2$ hybridized C atoms. Structures containing a mixture of $sp^2$ and $sp^3$ atoms, such as penta-graphene\cite{Zhang2015}, have been studied as well. This last structure contains a mixture of threefold and fourfold coordinated C atoms. This leads to a distorted structure with non-ideal bond angles that has higher formation energy than the non-distorted graphene and diamond crystals with their ideal planar and tetrahedral bonding geometry. Therefore, a system with a local bond structure resembling that of graphene or diamond will have lower energy. 

None of the above mentioned materials are magnetic because they contain only paired electrons. Local magnetic moments usually originate from lone electrons that are not involved in chemical bonding. Single atomic defects such as vacancies break covalent bonds and create lone electrons that give rise to magnetism. It is interesting to investigate whether a structural modification with a proper mixing of three- and fourfold coordinated C atoms can lead to local magnetic moments in a stable crystalline structure.  In this work, we propose such a new type of 2D carbon allotrope with non-trivial magnetic properties. This structure is composed of a mixture of pentagonal and hexagonal rings of carbon atoms and will be called penta-hexa-graphene (ph-graphene). This new material has an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state which transforms to a ferromagnetic (FM) state under strain. The latter state is protected by a small strain-induced energy barrier. These findings can initiate further research to induce magnetism and spin-flip barriers through strain in other metal-free 2D materials.

While finishing this manuscript, \citet{Zhang2016} reported our proposed structure in their supplementary materials. However, a detail study of the physical properties, especially the magnetic properties, of this structure was not reported.

\subsection{Bond hybirdization and magnetic moment \label{res}}

The structure of the proposed 2D material is schematically shown in \autoref{structure}. It consists of hexagonal rings of C atoms surrounded by six pentagonal rings which share one edge with the hexagon and four with other pentagons. These hexagonal and pentagonal rings are arranged in a hexagonal lattice to form an infinite monolayer sheet. Considering the complex structure of this system, it is important to understand the hybridization of the electronic orbitals. For this, we calculate the hybridization index of the three C atoms that have a unique local environment, namely C1, C2 and C3 in \autoref{angle}, through Coulson's theorem: $1+\sqrt{n_1n_2}~cos\theta_{12}=0$, where $\theta_{12}$ is the interorbital angle between orbital 1 and 2 (see \autoref{angle}) and $n$ is the hybridization index.  $n$ corresponds to the index in the $sp^n$ notation and determines the relative fraction of $p$ orbitals with respect to the $s$ orbital. The sum of the $s$ fractions in all hybridized orbitals should equal 1, while it should be 3 for the sum of the $p$ fractions.

\end{figure}


In \autoref{hybrid}, we list the hybridization indices of the C1 and C3 orbitals, $\varphi$.  The C1 atom has two $sp^2$ orbitals with 120$^{\circ}$ interorbital angle and one $sp^{2.72}$. The latter gives rise to a partly buckled structure. The fourth C1 orbital has a large $p$ contribution, indicating that it is close to a $p_z$ orbital with little $s$ contribution, and induces $\pi$ bonding in the hexagonal rings. The C2 atoms have fourfold coordination and their hybridization should be close to $sp^3$. Due to geometric constraints, the bonds have strained angles\cite{coulson1949}. Finally, the C3 atom has four quasi-$sp^3$ orbitals of which three are used for nearest-neighbor $\sigma$ bonding. The electron in the fourth orbital remains unpaired and can give a local magnetic moment of 1 $\mu_B$ (Bohr magneton). There are two C3 atoms per unit cell which form a graphene-like subcrystal. The maximal magnetic moment per unit cell is therefore  2$\mu_B$ if the system is ferromagnetic. However, when we align these two magnetic moments antiparallel, the total energy is lowered by 12 meV per magnetic atom, which gives an AFM ground state. 

In comparison to penta-graphene, ph-graphene has a 76 mev/atom lower formation energy. However, it is about 0.9 eV/atom higher than that of graphene. The relatively high formation energy of ph-graphene as compared to graphene can be mainly attributed to the ``bent'' bonds of the C2 atoms due to geometric constraints. 

To check the dynamical stability of the ph-graphene structure we calculated its phonon spectrum (see \autoref{phonon}). Since there are no imaginary frequencies, we can conclude that the structure is dynamically stable.

The electronic band structure and the charge densities at the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are shown in \autoref{electronic}. Both the FM and AFM states exhibit indirect semiconducting character with a band gap (PBE) of 1.06 eV and 0.96 eV, respectively. The band edge states are mainly located on the magnetic atoms and the band gap separates states of opposite spin orientation. The hybridized $\varphi_4$ states (see above) on these atoms form a $\pi$ bonding network that resembles the $p_z$ $\pi$ bonding in graphene. For the FM state, the typical graphene-like band structure that results from this can be observed for the valence and conduction bands. These bands are separated due to the ferromagnetic exchange splitting in spin-up and spin-down states with a large gap in between. Note that the splitting between bonding and anti-bonding states at the $\Gamma$ point is strongly reduced with respect to graphene because of the larger interatomic distance separating the C3 atoms (3.1 {\AA} in ph-graphene \textit{vs} 1.4 {\AA} in graphene). Due to this increased bonding distance, the exchange interaction exceeds the bonding interaction and the system is magnetic in stark contrast to graphene where the $\pi$ bonding is much stronger.


\subsection{Summary}
In this work, we proposed a new type of stable monolayer carbon allotrope composed of pentagonal and hexagonal rings of carbon atoms. We explained the symmetry and the structure of the bonds that result in local magnetic moments. By comparing the total energy of the FM and AFM state, we conclude that the latter is the ground state. Our theoretical calculations give insight in the magnetic mechanism in this metal-free material, which can initiate further work on the exploration of magnetic properties of other 2D metal-free material. In the later chapter, we will see how strain can play an important role to modulate the magnetic ground state of this material.


\section[Lithium battery related properties of MXenes/graphene heterostructure]{Lithium battery related properties of MXenes/graphene heterostructure \footcite[This work will be published as:][]{Aierken2017.battery}}

\subsection{Introduction}
Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used for the electrochemical energy storage in electrical vehicles and portable electronic devices such as cell phones. In fact, the speed of the development in these state of the art products mostly hinges on the progress in battery technology. In current state, energy densities and rate capabilities of both LIBs and sodium ion batteries (NIBs) are insufficient to satisfy costumers' needs. Therefore, the demand for the metal based new generation batteries that have large reversible energy/power capacity, good cyclic stability and long life span is growing day by day. Recently, rechargeable batteries based on 2D materials have garnered great attention because of their promising potential as anode materials with enhanced gravimetric and volumetric energy densities which is a key challenge in current rechargeable ion battery technology. For instance Mo$_2$C was shown to exhibit much better electrochemical properties in lithium-ion battery applications,\cite{mo2c-ref8, mo2c-ref10}. Moreover, other 2D layered materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides,\cite{mo2c-ref11, mo2c-ref12}, black phosphorus\cite{mo2c-ref18, mo2c-ref20}, and MXenes (with M = Ti, V, Nb, Mo and X = C, N)\cite{mo2c-ref13, mo2c-ref17} were also widely investigated because of their high energy storage density and high rate capacity. However, experimental studies have shown that single type layered nanosheets inevitably restack during the cycling process, resulting in a rapid capacity fading and poor rate performance. 

Therefore, current interest has been directed towards heterostructured\cite{C5CS00937E,Pomerantseva_Gogotsi_2017} 2D materials. A plausible design of vertical heterostructures from different 2D materials is expected to be beneficial for providing rapid electron transport and the acceleration of cation transport in the electrodes, and thus expected to improve the rate performance in current battery technology\cite{Pomerantseva_Gogotsi_2017}. In addition, the negligible volumetric changes of in particular TMDCs and MXenes under lithiation/de-lithiation processes, such that there is only 5\% in-plane lattice expansion in the Mo$_2$C lattice caused by Li intercalation\cite{C6TA01918H}, can minimize the intrinsic volumetric changes during charging/discharging processes and prolongs cycling lifetime of the rechargeable batteries. Also, combining different 2D materials is a promising way to adjust the interlayer distance to accommodate much larger (Na$^{+}$) and more polarized (Mg$^{2+}$) ions. For instance, lithium-ion capacity in excess of 750 mAh g$^{-1}$\cite{CELC:CELC201600059} has already been demonstrated for the batteries with MXene flakes electrodes, optimized with CNTs.

To this end, we systematically investigated Li intercalation in vertical (van der Waals) heterostructures of MXenes and graphene for rechargeable battery applications. We only considered functionalized MXenes with  OH and O, since the experimentally synthesized MXenes are often functionalized with various radicals due to the mainly used chemical exfoliation process in synthesis. In addition, MXenes with low formula weights, such as Ti$_2$C, Nb$_2$C, V$_2$C and Sc$_2$C have been found to be most promising\cite{doi:10.1021/ja405735d} materials for battery allocations due to their theoretically stated gravimetric capacity, which represents the amount of charge that can be stored per gram of material. Therefore, we considered olnly M$_2$CX$_2$ (where M=Sc, Ti, V and X=OH, O) monolayers in this study. V$_2$CX$_2$ is particularly important since it shows the highest Li$^+$ capacity of all MXenes tested under similar conditions\cite{doi:10.1021/ja508154e}. Another advantageous is that, compared to bilayer M$_2$CX$_2$, M$_2$CX$_2$/graphene hetorostructure has much smaller weight, offering much larger storage capacity. 

We introduce the following nomenclatures in the following sections: M stands for the transition metal in MXenes; X stands for the functionalized group, i.e. OH or O; Gr stands for graphene; Li is intercalated Li atom (unless the concentration is stated it means only single Li atom intercalation); Monolayer and bilayer are denoted with mono- or bi- prefixes; For instance: bi-Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Li stands for bilayer Ti$_2$CO$_2$ with a single Li atom intercalation, and Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li stands for heterostructure of Ti$_2$CO$_2$ on graphene with a single Li atom intercalation.

In addition, we calculated diffusion barriers for Li ions using the climbing-image nudge elastic (cNEB) method as implemented in the VASP transition state tools\cite{c-neb1,c-neb2}. The cNEB method is an efficient method to determine the minimum energy diffusion path between two given positions. We used at least 7 images, including initial and final positions, for cNEB calculations. The atomic positions and energy of the images were then relaxed until the largest norm of the force orthogonal to the path is smaller than 0.01 eV/{\AA}.

First of all, we need to construct the heterostructure. To minimize the lattice mismatch between layers, we constructed the heterostructures with a 3$\times$3 supercell of Sc$_2$CO$_2$ or Sc$_2$C(OH)$_2$ with a 4$\times$4 supercell of graphene, a  4$\times$4 supercell of Ti$_2$CO$_2$ or Ti$_2$C(OH)$_2$ with a 5$\times$5 supercell of graphene, and a 5$\times$5 supercell of V$_2$CO$_2$ or V$_2$C(OH)$_2$ with a 6$\times$6 supercell of graphene, see \autoref{Li_stacking} as a representative example. In order to find out the ground state stacking type of M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr heterostructures, we calculated the binding energy of possible stacking configurations by shifting the M$_2$CX$_2$ layer over the unit cell of graphene on a uniform mesh, see the supplementary materials$^\dag$ for details. In the course of these simulations, each layer in the heterostructure is regarded rigid where only the interlayer distance is allowed to relax. The regarded binding energy per atom, $E_b$ was calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
E_b=\frac{1}{N}[E(\mathrm{M}_2\mathrm{C}\mathrm{X}_2+\mathrm{Gr})-E(\mathrm{M}_2\mathrm{C}\mathrm{X}_2)-E(\mathrm{Gr})]
\end{equation}
where $E$(M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr), $E$(M$_2$CX$_2$) and $E$(Gr) are the total energies of M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr, mono-M$_2$CX$_2$ and Gr, respectively. $N$ is the total number of atoms in the system. In \autoref{tableI}, the calculated $E_b$ and the interlayer distance for M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr are given, and they are system dependent. The results for graphene bilayer are also given for a reference. The interlayer binding energy and the distance of bilayer graphene are 20 meV/atom and 3.325 {\AA}, respectively. Our calculations agree very well with a recent work in which quantum Monte Carlo simulations predicted a 17.8 meV/atom binding energy and 3.384 {\AA} interlayer separation for bilayer graphene\cite{PhysRevLett.115.115501}.  The calculated binding energies (i.e. $E_b$) are negative for all the considered heterostructures, demonstrating the stability of each system against the phase separation. The magnitudes of the $E_b$ for the ground states stacking in MXene oxides/graphene are comparable to that of bilayer graphene, whereas the hydroxides/graphene are slightly stronger bonded due to the extra hydrogen bonds. The differences in the binding energies among different MXenes that have the same functionalized group are negligible.

\subsection{Single Li intercalation and its binding energy}

\begin{figure}[htb]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{sites.eps}%
\caption{The locations of Li atoms intercalation between Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr heterostructure as an example.  \label{sites}}
\end{figure}

Having the ground state stacking types of all the M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr heterostructures, we now investigate the Li intercalation in these systems. To uncover potential of M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr heterostructures in battery applications, we also considered Li intercalation on mono-M$_2$CX$_2$, within bi-M$_2$CX$_2$ and within bi-Gr reference systems. These systems are considered the same dimensions, or equivalently the same Li atoms concentration, as in the corresponding heterostructures.

Previous studies\cite{Guo2015,Samad2016,Lee2012} have pointed out that the strongest binding for the Li atoms intercalated happens between bilayer heterostructure and reported a non-binding character of Li atoms on the surface of few-layer graphene, therefore, in this study, we limited our study considering only the intercalation between M$_2$CX$_2$ and graphene. In addition, inspired by the previous study\cite{doi:10.1063/1.4939745} for the Li absorption site in M$_2$CX$_2$ multilayer system, we discovered that intercalated Li atom bound close to the M$_2$CX$_2$ layer and far from graphene, and it resides itself between three O atoms, therefore each formula unit of M$_2$CX$_2$ in heterostructure can accommodate one Li atom. Additional Li atoms occupy same positions in other unit cells, as shown in \autoref{sites}. Note that, because of resulted reflection symmetry for ground state stacking, Li position only on one side of the symmetry line [110] is studied for a single Li absorption.  Since a strong binding between Li and M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr bilayer is necessary to avoid the formation of metallic lithium, and therefore to improve the safety and reversibility of lithium-ion batteries, we need to make sure the reported Li binding energy is the largest one (that it is associated to the ground state adsorption site). Thus, we have calculated all the possible adsorption sites between two layers, see the supplementary materials$^\dag$ for details. 

The binding energy, $E_{b}^{Li}$, for Li intercalated systems is defined through the following equation:
\begin{equation}
E_{b}^{Li}=\frac{1}{x}[E(\mathrm{with~}x\mathrm{Li})-E(\mathrm{without~Li})-xE(\mathrm{Li})],
\end{equation}
where $E(\mathrm{with~}x\mathrm{Li})$ and $E(\mathrm{without~Li})$ are the total energies of system with and without x Li atoms, respectively. $E(\mathrm{Li})$ is the total energy of a Li atom in its most stable bcc bulk structure. Here, a more negative binding energy indicates a more favourable exothermic binding of Li. 

In \autoref{my-label}, the results for different materials in three promising systems are shown. For comparison, we calculated Li intercalation in AA and AB stacked graphene bilayers. While the latter is more stable than the former for the pristine systems, the former is energetically more favourable for Li intercalation, consistent with previous calculations\cite{PhysRevB.93.245438}, see \autoref{my-label}.  The LiC$_{64}$ (4$\times$4 bilayer graphene) in AA configuration is energetically favorable to accommodate single Li between bilayer, while the Li atom will not bind at all in AB stack bilayer. However, the magnitude of binding energy generally is small as compared to the heterostructure due to the strong interaction of Li with M$_2$CO$_2$ layer.


The following findings are concluded from the results: 
(1) All systems related to Sc$_2$CO$_2$ experience severe structural distortion upon Li interactions. Two or three of the C atoms in the Sc$_2$CO$_2$ moving towards each other and showing the tendency to cluster. Therefore, this type of system is unstable for Li intercalation. 
(2) The binding of Li atom on mono-M$_2$C(OH)$_2$ is not favorable. This can be attributed to the Columbic repulsion between positively charged Li ion and H atoms. 
(3) As going from mono- to bi-M$_2$C(OH)$_2$+Li, Li adsorption is made stable again through the van der Waals interaction that competes with foregoing repulsive interaction.  
(4) mono-M$_2$CO$_2$+Li,  bi-M$_2$CX$_2$+Li and M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr+Li exhibit the strongest adsorption for Li atoms. The calculated $E_{b}^{Li}$ value at the largest binding energy site is -1.87 eV/atom for the mono-Ti$_2$CO$_2$ and -2.97 eV/atom for the mono-V$_2$CO$_2$. In the case of M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr+Li, we observed that $E_{b}^{Li}$ slightly decreases for M=Ti and V and X=O.  This may be correlated to the reduced van der Waals interaction with respect to the pristine bilayers due to the increase in interlayer separation.  
(5) We have identified three promising candidates with large Li atom adsorption energy, namely Sc$_2$C(OH)$_2$+Gr+Li, Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li and V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li. Therefore, for the rest of the section, we will focus on these three systems and will study the kinetics of Li diffusion.

\subsection{Effect of Li concentration}

As a next step, we investigated the effect of the Li ion concentration on the physical properties of M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr+Li heterostructures. Here, the concentration is defined as the ratio of the number of Li atoms and the number of formula unit of M$_2$CX$_2$ in the heterostructures (e.g. 100\% corresponds to one Li atom for each formula unit). \autoref{concenration}(a) shows the variation of average $E_{b}^{Li}$ as a function of concentration of the Li ions (i.e. $x$). As the number of intercalated Li increases,  average $E_{b}^{Li}$ decreases gradually. The reduction in binding energy is due to two main factors; One is the weak electrostatic attraction between M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr host and Li cations, and the other one is the enhanced Li-Li repulsion at high Li concentrations. The former is correlated with the reduction of charge transfer from the Li atom to M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr complex at high concentrations, as shown in \autoref{concenration}(b). Similarly, the latter is due to the reduction of interatomic distances between positively charged Li ions. Above a critical concentration value, namely 80\%,  $E_{b}^{Li}$ becomes positive for Sc$_2$C(OH)$_2$+Gr+Li, making this system energetically unstable for further Li insertion.  $E_{b}^{Li}$ is always negative for Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li and V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li, suggesting that these heterostructures are stable against Li intercalation, and thus we can safely disregard the phase separation into individual monolayers and bulk Li at high concentrations. In other words, the Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li and V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li structures has high stability even with high Li concentration. For V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li (Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li), $E_{b}^{Li}$ may vary by about 1 (0.5) eV as a function of Li concentration. Recently, Sun $et$ $al.$ \citet{doi:10.1021/acsami.5b03863}reported that V$_2$CO$_2$ undergoes a reversible structural transformation during the adsorption of Li. We also checked the possibility of such structural transformation for V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr bilayer and we found that presence of graphene prevents the transformation of V$_2$CO$_2$. Our results clearly demonstrated that Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li and V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li can be utilized as an anode material for high capacity Li ion batteries.

Another important point is how the structural stability of Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li and V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li is affected as the Li ions coverage is increased. We found that an increase in the number of Li ions leads to a small expansion in in-plane lattice constants.  For instance, the in-plane lattice constant of both V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li and Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li expands less than 1\%.   Besides, we did not observe  severe  lengthening of the surface Ti/V-O bonds and
shortening of Li-O bonds for both Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li and V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li heterostructures. For instance,
Li-O bond length decreases at most 3\% with increasing Li concentration.   
It is also found that Li intercalation slightly enlarges and later reduces the interlayer separation as Li concentration increased. The calculated interlayer separations suggested that we can have at most 0.5 {\AA} expansion as a result of Li intercalation. 
These results clearly suggest that we can have a reversible reaction that is requested for rechargeable ion batteries. Thus, the layered M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr heterostructures can effectively defy the volume expansion problem faced by the electrode materials. However, Sc$_2$C(OH)$_2$+Gr is unstable against Li loading to higher concentration.

\subsection{Electrochemical properties}

In order to gain insight into the electrochemical properties of the Li intercalation process into M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr heterostructure, the open-circuit-voltage was obtained by calculating the averaged half cell voltage over a range of metal ion concentrations $x$, where $x_1\leq x\leq x_2$, using,
\begin{equation}
V\approx\frac{E_{\mathrm{M}_2\mathrm{C}\mathrm{X}_2+\mathrm{Gr}+\mathrm{x_1Li}}-E_{\mathrm{M}_2\mathrm{C}\mathrm{X}_2+\mathrm{Gr}+\mathrm{x_2Li}}+(x_2-x_1)E_{\mathrm{Li}}}{(x_2-x_1)e}
\end{equation}
where $E_{\mathrm{M}_2\mathrm{C}\mathrm{X}_2+\mathrm{Gr}+\mathrm{Li}_{x_1}}$ and $E_{\mathrm{M}_2\mathrm{C}\mathrm{X}_2+\mathrm{Gr}+\mathrm{Li}_{x_2}}$ are the total energies of M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr heterostructure with $x_1$ and $x_2$ Li intercalated, respectively.  $E_{\mathrm{Li}}$ is the total energy of bulk bcc Li.  First of all, our calculations showed that the charging voltage for Li intercalation decreases with increase of Li atoms, as clearly seen in \autoref{concenration}(c). The calculated average voltage corresponding to Sc$_2$C(OH)$_2$+Gr+Li is negative for the Li ion concentration $x$ larger than 55\%. As mentioned above, a phase transition should be expected for the concentrations larger than this critical value. Our results are consistent with a recent work reporting that H and/or OH should be avoided if possible since they result in a lower capacity and negative cell voltage\cite{Xie2014,Tang2012}. On the other hand, the available intercalation sites in Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li and V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li composites can be fully occupied.
As we increase the Li concentration from $x$=50\% to 100\%, the open-circuit voltage decreases from 1.59 (1.94) V to 1.13 (1.38) V for Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li (V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li). The binding energy change (i.e $E_{b}^{Li}$) during Li intercalation can be correlated with the voltage value. Since V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li has the largest Li binding energy, the calculated voltage value is also the largest. The calculated average voltage profile is 1.49 V for Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li and 1.93 V for V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li, which are higher than those of Mo$_2$C\cite{C6TA01918H}, graphite\cite{ceder4} and TiO$_2$ electrode \cite{tio2-voltage} and lower than phosphorene\cite{doi:10.1021/nl504336h}. Experimentally measured maximum voltages for pure V$_2$CO$_2$ and Ti$_2$CO$_2$ anodes are 3.0 V and 2.5 V, respectively\cite{doi:10.1021/ja405735d,gdgdgd}. Combining graphene with V$_2$CO$_2$ or Ti$_2$CO$_2$ reduces maximum voltages by around 0.5 V.  Approximately 50\% of capacity of V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li (Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li) is intercalated above 2 (1.6) V, with the rest intercalating at lower voltages. Our results clearly demonstrate that Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li can be exploited in low voltage applications and V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li are suitable for high charging voltage applications.

\subsection{Diffusion properties}

\end{figure}

A low diffusion barrier and high mobility are the requirements of an efficient electrode material. In particular, the mobility of a metal atom on an electrode material is a key factor determining the rate performance during charging and discharging of a battery. Following the thermodynamic consideration of Li intercalation, we investigated the single Li kinetics on mono-M+Li, within bi-M+Li and within M+Gr+Li heterostructures, where here M=(Sc$_2$C(OH)$_2$,Ti$_2$CO$_2$,V$_2$CO$_2$), by calculating the lowest energy Li atom diffusion path connecting two adjacent binding sites using cNEB method, see \autoref{path}. The determined energy profiles of the paths are shown in \autoref{barrier}. 
Compared to the bilayer systems, Li displays relatively smaller diffusion barriers on the pristine monolayers. In other words, energy barriers of Li ions in M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr+Li heterostructure are always higher than those of monolayers. For instance, while energy barriers is calculated as 0.16 eV on the mono-V$_2$CO$_2$+Li, it is obtained as 0.6 eV for bi-V$_2$CO$_2$+Li and V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr+Li heterestructure. Since the multilayer system has the advantage of having higher capacity than the single monolayer system in given volume, and also the synthesized M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr will mostly be multilayered, we believe that the monolayer structures represent the lower limit for energy barriers. However, to obtain realistic kinetics properties we should consider diffusion of ions between layers not only on isolated monolayers. Another important point is that surface functionalization increases the barrier remarkably\cite{doi:10.1021/jp504493a}. Interestingly, energy barriers for Ti based systems are similar, varying in the range of 0.22-032 eV.  Our calculated energy barriers for mono-Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Li is consistent with a recent work\cite{doi:10.1021/jp504493a}. Energy barriers for Ti-based systems are lower than that of graphite (0.5 eV)\cite{Thinius2014} and high-capacity bulk silicon anode materials with a diffusion barrier around 0.57 eV, comparable to the commercially used anode materials based on TiO$_2$ with a barrier of 0.35-0.65 eV\cite{tio2-barrier,tio2-barrier-4,tio2-barrier-3}, suggesting that heterostructures of Ti-based MXenes with graphene are promising candidates for electrode materials in battery applications. The diffusion barriers can be reduced by weakening the interaction of Li ions with the constituent layers. This can be achieved by fabricated pillar structures in which the interlayer distance of graphene and MXenes is enlarged by the help of intercalated molecules \cite{Luo2017}. This method can also improve the storage capacity by multilayer absorption between the layers. 



\subsection{Summary}
We carried out first-principles calculations to systematically investigate the Li atoms intercalation in MXenes/graphene vertical bilayer heterostructure for Li battery application. Six members in Mxenes family were chosen to form heterostructures with graphene: M$_2$CX$_2$+Gr (where M=Sc, Ti, V and X=OH, O). The ground state stacking types of bilayer and the strongest binding sites of Li atoms are determined first. The strength of the binding of bilayer heterostructure is comparable to that of bilayer graphene, and it is stronger than MXenes bilayers. Due to a finite mismatch of lattice constant of MXenes and graphene, relative motion of bilayer in heterostructure require less energy as compared with the other two cases and giving low fiction between them. We identified two promising heterostructure for Li intercalation: Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr and V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr. The stability of the heterostructure upon Li intercalation is confirmed through 1) small variations of the structural parameters , e.g. in-plane lattice parameters ($<$1\%) and interlayer separation ($<$0.5 {\AA}); 2) Large negative binding energies of Li atoms, e.g. larger than that in bilayer graphene; 3) Li atom donates a significant amount of charge to the host materials and exists in the cationic state. We found that all possible Li absorption sites can be occupied without destroying stability, namely 100\% Li intercalation, leading an average open circuit voltage of 1.49 V for Ti$_2$CO$_2$+Gr and 1.93 V for V$_2$CO$_2$+Gr. Especially, Ti$_2$CO$_2$ MXene offers a compromise between capacity and kinetics since the calculated diffusion barriers are the lowest among other systems studied and lower than that of graphene.  It is suggested from the study that a balance between the storage capacity and kinetics for practical applications should be made when selecting a promising candidate. Due to their lower molecular weights as compared to bare MXenes bilayers,  MXene+Gr heterostructure offer higher storage density, they also have the advantage of their good electrical conductivity which is an essential property for a proper operation of a battery.
