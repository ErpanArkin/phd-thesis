In this thesis, the properties of materials are virtually divided into preliminary and advanced categories. In this chapter, we will focus on the preliminary properties of 2D materials, namely structural, electronic, vibrational and mechanical properties. These properties are considered as test calculations and knowledge which the advanced properties in the next chapter are closely related to. They are composed of both my original calculations and results from literatures. An emphasis will be made on the characteristic properties of 2D materials.

\section{Structural properties}
\subsection{Layer structure}

As has seen in the \fullref{chap:1}, layered materials have a closest relationship with 2D materials. The strong anisotropic structure in the former results in the layer concept. This anisotropic nature attributes to the weak interlayer bonding and the strong intralayer bonding. The van der Waals interaction (vdWs)\cite{vdws} is the main type of this weak bonding. vdWs is the attraction and repulsion between atoms or molecules entities caused by dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole and instantaneous induced dipole-induced dipole forces. The definition is sometimes extended to include other weak forces between molecules as well.  For the 2D materials, vdWs interaction become important as the number of layers becomes larger than one: few-layer materials with typical number of layers less than ten. They also belong to the 2D materials family since the thickness of the materials still small such that quantum confinements still play role. As in its layered bulk part, a few-layer system is stacked of monolayers that hold together through vdWs. When no other bonding types are presented, interlayer vdWs determines all the change brought by going above single layer and its impact on the electronic structure will be significant. For example, as going from monolayer to bilayer, the linear dispersion relation of energy $E$ and momentum $k$ evolves into parabolic-like spectrum\cite{Partoens2006,Mak2010}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

\label{fig:gra_bands}
\end{figure} 

In \autoref{fig:gra_bands} (a), the dispersion relation in graphite along the z direction, that is the HKH line in the Brillouin zone, is shown in blue plane. This direction is perpendicular to the graphite layers. Because of the interlayer interaction and quantum confinements, in few-layer system, the finite thickness limits the number of wave vectors that standing waves can take.  Therefore, if only the intralayer and interlayer interactions between nearest neighbour atoms were considered, the dispersion relations in few-layer systems could be considered as the dispersions on the corss-section of red planes that cut the graphite Brillouin zone, see \autoref{fig:gra_bands} (a).  These planes are perpendicular to the z direction and intersect with the HKH line at possible points. This is called the zone-folding of dispersion relations\cite{saito1998physical}. These points are illustrated in \autoref{fig:gra_bands} (b). Under the condition that quantum confinements at few-layer system require the wave functions vanish at the imaginary layer outside the surface of the system, the systems will have well-defined wave vectors. Then, the dispersion relations will be on the plane intersects at $k_z=\pi/c$ and at $kz=2(\pi/3c)$ for graphene and bilayer graphene, respectively.  Having the knowledge of 3D band structure of graphite, we can approximate the dispersion of few-layer systems in this way. As a result, as shown in red plane in \autoref{fig:gra_bands} (a) and their 3D version in \autoref{fig:gra_bands} (c), graphene has linear dispersion relations and bilayer graphene has parabolic-like two dispersion bands. Moreover, the bilayer structure will never pass through the H point where graphene has passed and have linear dispersion relation. This is because of standing waves in bilayer will have a wave vector $k=2(n \pi/3c)$, where $n$ is a positive integer: 1, 2, ... , n. This will not equal to $\pi/c$ for any number of $n$. More generally, systems with an even number of layers will not have linear dispersion; whereas systems with an odd number of layers always have linear dispersion relation. Further, if other interactions were considered, an overlap of bands those touch each other in (c) would happened\cite{Partoens2006}. This overlap increases with the number of layers. Eventually in graphite, maximum overlap is reached.

\label{fig:mos2_band}
\end{figure} 

Another example of the importance of interlayer interaction in the few-layer 2D materials will the MoS$_2$. As mentioned in the \fullref{chap:1}, as going from bulk to monolayer, MoS$_2$ transforms from an indirect band gap to a direct one. Here again we can make use of zone-folding to approximate the band structure of monolayer from layered bulk one. The monolayer and the layered structure of 2H phase is shown in \autoref{fig:mos2_band} (a). In (b) let us focus on the difference of dispersion relations on the planes parallel to the page passing through K$\Gamma$ and HA lines (simply call them K$\Gamma$ and HA planes below). Same as the graphite, 2H layered MoS$_2$ has two layers per unit cell. Therefore, according to the standing wave arguments that we have used for graphene above, HA plane represents the monolayer. $E_g$ and $E\prime_g$ are the band gap of monolayer and layered bulk structures. Here not only the magnitude of band gap increased as going from bulk to monolayer, character of the band gap has changed as well. It is shown that this is due to the band edges change. Interlayer interactions widen top valence bands at $\Gamma$ and bottom conduction band at the middle of $\Gamma$K line, which without interlayer interaction should be degenerated. Therefore, these two band edges become the ones those determine the band gap instead of band edges at $K$ in the monolayer. Contrast to this, band edges at $K$ are not effected too much by the interlayer interaction to make a difference. When we compare the difference between band edges of K and other two is, we could find out that the latter two have much larger contribution from p$_z$ orbitals that give maximum interlayer orbital overlap hence interlayer interaction than d orbitals that dominant at $K$ point.


\subsection{sp hybirdization}

When atoms come together form bonds, the orientations of these bonds are decisive for the final structure. The sp hybridization is a good example of this.  It can mainly exist in three different variants: sp, sp$^2$ and sp$^3$, see \autoref{fig:sp_hybrid}. The hybridization index $n$ in sp$^n$ stands for the relative amount of p character in the hybridization. For example, sp$^2$ has 1/3 s character and 2/3 p character. Hybridized bonds  tend to maximized their distance to reduce the energy raised by the repulsion of electrons. As shown in \autoref{fig:sp_hybrid}, this results in tetrahedral structure of diamond that made of sp$^3$ bonds, trigonal planar structure of graphite or graphene that made of sp$^2$ and linear structure of ethyne molecules that made of sp bonds.  \citet{coulson1949} generalized the relation of bond angle and $n$ in the following way:

\begin{equation}
1=-\sqrt{n_1n_2}~cos\theta_{12}, 
\end{equation}

where $\theta_{12}$ is the bond angle between orbital 1 and 2. The bond angle can be measured in atomic simulations, yet we still need one more constrain to solve the equation for $n$ if orbital 1 and 2 have different $n$. This constrain is that, in the case of carbon atom, the total fractions of all s hybridized orbitals should equal 1, while it should be 3 for the sum of the p fractions. Consequently, each bond from one atom can be assigned with a unique $n$. This formula is useful to determine the s and p composition of the bonds. For example, $\theta_{12}=90^o$ gives $n\rightarrow\infty$, which means it is pure p orbital; $\theta_{12}=120^o$ gives $n=2$, that is a sp$^2$ bond. Generally, wider bond angle corresponds to large s contribution. Of course, this is more useful when the bond angle takes value other than those three types of hybridized bonds mentioned. Then we can use it to explain resulting geometrical structure.

\section{Electronic properties}

Electronic properties is one of the first feature we usually like to know about the new materials. Not only it is because semiconductor and metal have different role in applications, but also because the details of the electronic structure set the direction towards which further exploration should be carried out. One example for this from my experience is that from monitoring the electronic structure variations under a strain we had predicted how the mobility of the carrier can be tuned. This will be discussed in the later chapter. Therefore, it is important to understand this property of a new material to fully reveal its potentials. Electronic properties usually characterized by band structure (BS) and density of states (DOS). These calculations are standard calculations in first-principles codes where all consequent calculations start. After solving the Kohn-Sham equation with proper cut-off energy, k points etc., we will have all eigenenergy of each state identified with k point in the Brillouin zone and band index.  DOS is a count of the number of states at specific energy. BS is the plot of eigenenergy verse the line in Brillouin zone that connects high symmetry k points.  2D material has vast variation of electronic properties. From semimetallic graphene to semiconducting MoS$_2$ and to insulating BN. We have already seen these in the introduction. The purpose of this section is to point out some of the interesting electronic properties of some 2D materials. We will start with a brief introduction to the electronic properties of graphene.

\subsection{Example: graphene}

As mentioned before, orbitals in graphene are sp$^2$ hybridized. Each one of this sp$^2$ orbitals, coloured as green in \autoref{fig:gra_bond}, are composed from s, p$_x$ and p$_y$ orbitals. The p$_z$ orbital is left unchanged, coloured as yellow in the figure. One $sp2$ hybridized orbital with another one from adjacent atom form strong $\sigma$ bond, while $p_z$ orbitals form $\pi$ bonds. It may look like an alternative single and double bonds between atoms, actually according to the Clar's theory, the bond order, i.e. the number of chemical bonds between a pair of atoms, in graphene is 4/3 and it is uniform\cite{Wassmann2010}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!] 
\centering  
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{double_bond}
\caption{The formation of $sp^2$ $\sigma$ and $p_z$ $\pi$ double bond. Image source: \cite{gra_bond}. }  
\label{fig:gra_bond}
\end{figure} 

Every atom has same local environment, however, adjacent atoms are not equivalent. They belong to different hexagonal sublattices $A$ and $B$ as indicated with blue and yellow colors in \autoref{fig:gra_lat}. $a_1$ and $a_2$ are the basis vectors in real space connecting equivalent sites. $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the basis vectors in reciprocal space connecting equivalent k points. The hexagon in the reciprocal space is the first Brillouin zone where all inequivalent k points are contained. These kpoints associate with different parallel lines of atoms and thus also indicate different directions in the real space. The k wave vectors near the $\Gamma$ point have longer wave length, while those at the boundary of the first Brillouin zone have a wave length that is two times the unitcell dimension on that direction. For example, the most interesting k point for graphene is the $K$ and $K'$ points. These directions correspond to the $a_1$ and $a_2$ directions in real space. It is only at these k points in the Brioulloin zone, the antibinding and bonding $\pi$ band touch each other. Addition to this, as we have discussed in the introduction the Dirac cones will form around theses k points. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!] 
\centering  
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{gra_lat.eps}
\caption{Graphene lattice and its Brillion zone. Image source: \cite{CastroNeto2009}. }  
\label{fig:gra_lat}
\end{figure} 

As compared to $\pi$ bond, $\sigma$ bond originate from strong overlap of $sp^2$ orbitals. The interaction is strong and the splitting of bonding and antibonding orbitals are large. Which makes the $\sigma$ bonding orbitals deep in energy, or in other word, makes it strong and difficult to break. This feature contribute the most to the mechanical strength of graphene. On the other hand, $p_z$ orbitals are less overlapped. This makes the $\pi$ bond energy close to Fermi level, i.e. the highest occupied state. Therefore, they contribute the most to the electronic properties of graphene.  


\subsection{Dirac cone and symmetry}

We have seen that graphene, silicene and germanene have an interesting electronic structure: Dirac cone. We also have listed the consequences of having such fearture: high mobility, massless carrier etc.. In this section, we will discuss the symmetry condition for the existence of Dirac cones. This knowledge is useful to find more materials of this type. 

According to von Neumann-Wigner theorem, the space-time inversion symmetry is crucial for the existence and protection of Dirac cones\cite{Wang2015b}. It is a combination of space inversion and time reversal symmetries. These two are equally important and has to act simultaneously for the possible formation of Dirac cones. More restrict condition that guarantee the existence of Dirac cones has to deal with relations of hopping integrals\cite{Hasegawa2006,Liu2013}. It is from the \citet{Liu2013}'s study that it revealed the hexagonal lattice has the most favourable structure to posses Dirac cones. The probability decreases as one goes from hexagonal to square lattice, as shown in \autoref{fig:dirac_hs}.

\subsection{Accurate description from DFT}

\section{Vibrational properties}

The force on a atom can be calculated from wave functions that are evaluated from DFT thanks to the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. When searching for the equilibrium geometry of the materials, one basically trying different positions of atoms to find a geometry that minimized all the forces. This usually is the first thing to do for a new materials, since different codes, implementation and, more importantly, different funcationals will give different results. Despite the fact that the difference is usually small, unrelaxed geometry will have residual forces on atoms. This is particularly important when vibrational properties are concerned. The way vibrational properties are characterized are through the energy (usually expressed in terms of frequency) verse vibrational wave vector dispersion relations.  In crystal,  All atoms have a equilibrium positions that consist with the lattice points. Atoms vibrate around their equilibrium positions. The vibrational modes are quantized into phonons. Each phonon represent a periodic, collective vibration with well-defined vibrational mode and wave vector. The forces ($F$) resort the atoms when they deviate from their equilibrium positions can be calculate from DFT either by introducing small displacement or from perturbation theory. Then, force constants, $\Phi$, can be constructed by monitoring the forces change through displacements, $u$, of atoms in the following way:

\begin{equation}
\Phi_{i\alpha,j\beta}= \frac{\partial F_{j\beta}}{\partial u_{i\alpha}},
\end{equation} 

where the $i,j$ indices are the label for atoms, $\alpha,\beta$ are the Cartesian directions. The Fourier transformation of the force constants at wave vector $\mathbf{q}$ is the dynamical matrix $D(\mathbf{q})$ that related to the frequency of the phonon through eigenvalue problem:

\begin{equation}
\omega^2(\mathbf{q},n)\mathbf{e}(\mathbf{q},n)=D(\mathbf{q})\mathbf{e}(\mathbf{q},n),
\end{equation}

where $\omega$ is the frequency of the phonon in mode $n$ having a $\mathbf{q}$ wave vector, and $\mathbf{e}(\mathbf{q},n)$ is the eigenvector\cite{Ackland1997,Parlinski2011}.  These modes of phonons categorized into two main branches: acoustic and optical modes. Optical mode has differently charge polarized atoms vibrate with respect to each other and can interact with light, while acoustic mode all atoms in the unit cell move in phase. Further, considering the directions of the wave ($\mathbf{e}$) and vibration ($\mathbf{q}$), the modes subcategorized into transverse optical (TO) and transvers acoustice (TA): ($\mathbf{q} \perp \mathbf{e}$), longitudinal optical (LO) and longitudinal acoustic (LA) ($\mathbf{q} \parallel \mathbf{e}$). These modes are all in-plane vibrations for 2D materials. For such a case, another direction is also important, namely the $\mathbf{c}$ lattice vector perpendicular to the 2D plane. Therefore, special modes exist: out-of-plane transverse optical (ZO) and out-of-plane transverse acoustic (ZA) ($\mathbf{q} \perp \mathbf{e}$ and $\mathbf{q} \parallel c$). The total number of acoustic modes is three, that of optical modes is 3N-3. 

\subsection{Example: monolayer MoS$_2$}

Let us now take an example of layered bulk and monolayer MoS$_2$ to highlight some of the important details of phonon dispersion relations. A mode comparison between bulk and monolayer MoS$_2$ is presented in \autoref{fig:mos2_ph} (a). The reduction of dimensionality also reduce the independent optical modes. Another characteristic feature of layered and 2D materials is the quadratic ZA mode (flexural mode). It is usually linear in 3D bulk materials. The interlayer interaction is weak in layered and absent in 2D materials make this mode soft. As can be seen in \autoref{fig:mos2_ph} (b), phonon with longer wave length in ZA mode has smaller frequency or energy. It means this mode is easier get excited at low temperature and forms ripples which have been commonly observed in 2D materials. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

\label{fig:mos2_ph}
\end{figure} 


\subsection{Dynamic stability from phonon dispersion}

One of the most important output of phonon dispersion is the dynamical stability of the structure. The instability of a structure usually captured by the presence of imaginary frequency in its phonon dispersions, see \autoref{fig:img_band} for example. 


\begin{figure}[htbp!] 
\centering  
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img_band.png}
\caption{ Imaginary frequencies shown as negative frequencies in a phonon dispersion plot.}  
\label{fig:img_band}
\end{figure} 

\begin{figure}[htbp!] 
\centering  
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fre_ima.eps}
\caption{ (a) A structure at the convex (left) and concave (right) of the PES. (b) Searching for stable structure (phase transition).}  
\label{fig:fre_ima}
\end{figure} 

Consider a relaxed structure that forces on all atoms are vanished. This could be on a convex or a concave of the potential energy surface (PES), see \autoref{fig:fre_ima}. Note that, in both situations the force are zero, which means both situations can happen when the structure is relaxed only following the force. In the case of PES convex, the dynamical matrix $D(\mathbf{q})$ will have negative components related to the square of frequency $\omega$, hence imaginary frequency is the solution. Structure with imaginary frequency near $\Gamma$ q point not necessarily means it is not stable. Since a large supercell consist of multiple of unit cell is typically used to do phonon calculations. It may happen the size of the supercell is not large enough to correctly describe long wavelength phonons. However, structure with imaginary frequency appears at other q points than $\Gamma$ would imply a structure instability or structural phase transition is preferred. Nonetheless, with advanced technique in software\cite{Togo20151}, it is possible to modulate such structure based on the vibration mode which has imaginary frequency to find a lower energy state and stabilize the structure, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:fre_ima} (b).



\section{Mechanical properties}

In \fullref{chap:1}, we have seen the stiffness and strength of some of the 2D materials. They all belong to the mechanical properties of the materials. Force on atoms or the stress $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ on the unit cell under finite strain $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ are the typical outputs from first-principles codes. Within the elastic regime of stress-strain relation, they can be related through elastic constant $\boldsymbol{C}$: $\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\boldsymbol{C}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$, this is the Hook's law. $\boldsymbol{C}$ is a 6$\times$6 matrix whose matrix elements has a form $C_{ij}$. The elements measure the resistance of materials in $i$ direction to a deformation in $j$ direction, where $i$ and $j$ are the index of stress and strain tensors, respectively.  Under the Voigt notations, the indices have the following correspondence: 1$\rightarrow$ xx, 2$\rightarrow$ yy, 3$\rightarrow$ zz, 4$\rightarrow$ yz, 5$\rightarrow$ zx, 6$\rightarrow$ xy. In 2D hexagonal lattice symmetry, the Hook's law reads:

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{c} \sigma_1 \\ \sigma_2 \\ \sigma_6 \end{array} 
\end{pmatrix}
=
 \begin{pmatrix}
  C_{11} & C_{12} & 0  \\
  C_{12} & C_{11} & 0  \\
  0 & 0 & (C_{11}-C_{12})/2
 \end{pmatrix}
 \begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{c} \epsilon_1 \\ \epsilon_2 \\ \epsilon_6 
\end{array} \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation} 

In this way, all elastic constants can be extract from stress-strain data from the first-principles calculations. However, it is more convenient to have one quantity to describe each aspect of the mechanical properties of the materials. This is where Young's modulus $Y$, shear modulus $G$ and Poisson's ratio $\nu$ become useful. Following the previous notation, they defined as 

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}

Y_\alpha=\frac{1}{S_{\alpha\alpha}},\hspace{6 pt} \alpha = 1, 2, 3
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\nu_{\alpha\beta}=-Y_\beta S_{\alpha\beta},\hspace{6 pt} \alpha, \beta = 1, 2, 3 
\hspace{6 pt}(\alpha\neq\beta)
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
G_{\gamma\gamma}=\frac{1}{S_{\gamma\gamma}} ,\hspace{6 pt} \gamma = 4, 5, 6
\end{array},
\end{equation}

where $\boldsymbol{S}=\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}$ is the compliance matrix \citep[e.g.][]{nye1985physical}. Young's and shear modulus give the stiffness of the materials to stretching and shearing deformation on particular direction. Whereas Poisson's ratio gives the ratio of the transverse to the axial strain, represents how easy it is to change the shape of the material with respect to the volume. Liquid and rubber have a Poisson's ratio close to 0.5, which is the theoretical upper limit of this quantity. Breaking strength/strain is a measure of load limit that the material can sustain, and it is characterized how strong a material is. This quantity is usually obtained by continuously deform the materials until it break where the maximum stress/strain gives the corresponding limits.
