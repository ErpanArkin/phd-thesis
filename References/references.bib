abstract = {Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

The breaking strength is 42 N m{\textendash}1 and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young{\textquoteright}s modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = {\textendash}2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of σint = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite.

  abstract={We review transport experiments on graphene quantum dots and narrow graphene constrictions. In a quantum dot, electrons are confined in all lateral dimensions, offering the possibility for detailed investigation and controlled manipulation of individual quantum systems. The recently isolated two-dimensional carbon allotrope graphene is an interesting host to study quantum phenomena, due to its novel electronic properties and the expected weak interaction of the electron spin with the material. Graphene quantum dots are fabricated by etching mono-layer flakes into small islands (diameter 60–350 nm) with narrow connections to contacts (width 20–75 nm), serving as tunneling barriers for transport spectroscopy. Electron confinement in graphene quantum dots is observed by measuring Coulomb blockade and transport through excited states, a manifestation of quantum confinement. Measurements in a magnetic field perpendicular to the sample plane allowed to identify the regime with only a few charge carriers in the dot (electron–hole transition), and the crossover to the formation of the graphene specific zero-energy Landau level at high fields. After rotation of the sample into parallel magnetic field orientation, Zeeman spin splitting with a g -factor of g ≈ 2 is measured. The filling sequence of subsequent spin states is similar to what was found in GaAs and related to the non-negligible influence of exchange interactions among the electrons.}

Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the obtained graphene derivative (graphane) is crystalline and retains the hexagonal lattice, but its period becomes markedly shorter than that of graphene. The reaction with hydrogen is reversible, so that the original metallic state, the lattice spacing, and even the quantum Hall effect can be restored by annealing. Our work illustrates the concept of graphene as a robust atomic-scale scaffold on the basis of which new two-dimensional crystals with designed electronic and other properties can be created by attaching other atoms and molecules.},

abstract  ="Silicene{,} a graphene analogue of silicon{,} has been generating immense interest due to its potential for applications in miniaturized devices. Unlike planar graphene{,} silicene prefers a buckled structure. Here we explore the possibility of stabilizing the planar form of silicene by Ni doping using first principles density functional theory based calculations. It is found that planar as well as buckled structure is stable for Ni-doped silicene{,} but the buckled sheet has slightly lower total energy. The planar silicene sheet has unstable phonon modes. A comparative study of the mechanical properties reveals that the in-plane stiffness of both the pristine and the doped planar silicene is higher compared to that of the buckled silicene. This suggests that planar silicene is mechanically more robust. Electronic structure calculations of the planar and buckled Ni-doped silicene show that the energy bands at the Dirac point transform from linear behavior to parabolic dispersion. Furthermore{,} we extend our study to Ge and Sn sheets that are also stable and the trends of comparable mechanical stability of the planar and buckled phases remain the same."}

  abstract = {Atomically thin boron nitride (BN) is an important 2D nanomaterial, with many properties distinct from graphene. In this feature article, these unique properties and associated applications, often not feasible with graphene, are outlined. The article starts with characterization and identification of atomically thin BN. It is followed by demonstrating their strong oxidation resistance at high temperatures and applications in protecting metals from oxidation and corrosion. As flat insulators, BN nanosheets are ideal dielectric substrates for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and electronic devices based on 2D heterostructures. The light emission of BN nanosheets in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) and ultraviolet (UV) regions is also included for its scientific and technological importance. The last part is dedicated to synthesis, characterization, and optical properties of BN nanoribbons, a special form of nanosheets.}

abstract  ="Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been under scientific investigation for more than fifteen years because of their unique properties that predestine them for many potential applications. The field of nanotechnology and nanoscience push their investigation forward to produce CNTs with suitable parameters for future applications. It is evident that new approaches of their synthesis need to be developed and optimized. In this paper we review history{,} types{,} structure and especially the different synthesis methods for CNTs preparation including arc discharge{,} laser ablation and chemical vapour deposition. Moreover{,} we mention some rarely used ways of arc discharge deposition which involves arc discharge in liquid solutions in contrary to standard used deposition in a gas atmosphere. In addition{,} the methods for uniform vertically aligned CNTs synthesis using lithographic techniques for catalyst deposition as well as a method utilizing a nanoporous anodized aluminium oxide as a pattern for selective CNTs growth are reported too."}

  abstract = {Graphene has been widely heralded over the last decade as one of the most promising nanomaterials for integrated, miniaturized applications spanning from nanoelectronics, interconnections, thermal management, sensing, to optoelectronics. Graphene grown on silicon carbide is currently the most likely candidate to fulfill this promise. As a matter of fact, the capability to synthesize high-quality graphene over large areas using processes and substrates compatible as much as possible with the well-established semiconductor manufacturing technologies is one crucial requirement. We review here, the enormous scientific and technological advances achieved in terms of epitaxial growth of graphene from thermal decomposition of bulk silicon carbide and the fine control of the graphene electronic properties through intercalation. Finally, we discuss perspectives on epitaxial graphene growth from silicon carbide on silicon, a particularly challenging area that could result in maximum benefit for the integration of graphene with silicon technologies.}
