abstract  ="Recently penta-graphene was proposed as a stable two-dimensional carbon allotrope consisting of a single layer of interconnected carbon pentagons [Zhang et al.{,} PNAS{,} 2015{,} 112{,} 2372]. Its silicon counterpart{,} penta-silicene{,} however{,} is not stable. In this work{,} we show that multilayers of penta-silicene form stable materials with semiconducting or metallic properties{,} depending on the stacking mode. We demonstrate their dynamic stability through their phonon spectrum and using molecular dynamics. A particular type of bilayer penta-silicene is found to have lower energy than all of the known hexagonal silicene bilayers and forms therefore the most stable bilayer silicon material predicted so far. The electronic and mechanical properties of these new silicon allotropes are studied in detail and their behavior under strain is investigated. We demonstrate that strain can be used to tune its band gap."}

abstract  ="Strain engineering is an effective way to tune the intrinsic properties of a material. Here{,} we show by using first-principles calculations that both uniaxial and biaxial tensile strain applied to monolayer TiS3 are able to significantly modify its intrinsic mobility. From the elastic modulus and the phonon dispersion relation we determine the tensile strain range where structure dynamical stability of the monolayer is guaranteed. Within this region{,} we find more than one order of enhancement of the acoustic phonon limited mobility at 300 K (100 K){,} i.e. from 1.71 [times] 104 (5.13 [times] 104) cm2 V-1 s-1 to 5.53 [times] 105 (1.66 [times] 106) cm2 V-1 s-1. The degree of anisotropy in both mobility and effective mass can be tuned by using tensile strain. Furthermore{,} we can either increase or decrease the band gap of TiS3 monolayer by applying strain along different crystal directions. This property allows us to use TiS3 not only in electronic but also in optical applications."}

It has also led to the establishment of a new metrological standard, the resistance quantum. Disappointingly, however, the QHE has been observed only at liquid-helium temperatures. We show that in graphene, in a single atomic layer of carbon, the QHE can be measured reliably even at room temperature, which makes possible QHE resistance standards becoming available to a broader community, outside a few national institutions.},

Graphene quantum dots are fabricated by etching mono-layer flakes into small islands (diameter 60-350 nm) with narrow connections to contacts (width 20-75 nm), serving as tunneling barriers for transport spectroscopy. Electron confinement in graphene quantum dots is observed by measuring Coulomb blockade and transport through excited states, a manifestation of quantum confinement. Measurements in a magnetic field perpendicular to the sample plane allowed to identify the regime with only a few charge carriers in the dot (electron-hole transition), and the crossover to the formation of the graphene specific zero-energy Landau level at high fields. After rotation of the sample into parallel magnetic field orientation, Zeeman spin splitting with a g -factor of g ≈ 2 is measured. The filling sequence of subsequent spin states is similar to what was found in GaAs and related to the non-negligible influence of exchange interactions among the electrons.}

Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the obtained graphene derivative (graphane) is crystalline and retains the hexagonal lattice, but its period becomes markedly shorter than that of graphene. The reaction with hydrogen is reversible, so that the original metallic state, the lattice spacing, and even the quantum Hall effect can be restored by annealing. Our work illustrates the concept of graphene as a robust atomic-scale scaffold on the basis of which new two-dimensional crystals with designed electronic and other properties can be created by attaching other atoms and molecules.},

abstract  ="Silicene{,} a graphene analogue of silicon{,} has been generating immense interest due to its potential for applications in miniaturized devices. Unlike planar graphene{,} silicene prefers a buckled structure. Here we explore the possibility of stabilizing the planar form of silicene by Ni doping using first principles density functional theory based calculations. It is found that planar as well as buckled structure is stable for Ni-doped silicene{,} but the buckled sheet has slightly lower total energy. The planar silicene sheet has unstable phonon modes. A comparative study of the mechanical properties reveals that the in-plane stiffness of both the pristine and the doped planar silicene is higher compared to that of the buckled silicene. This suggests that planar silicene is mechanically more robust. Electronic structure calculations of the planar and buckled Ni-doped silicene show that the energy bands at the Dirac point transform from linear behavior to parabolic dispersion. Furthermore{,} we extend our study to Ge and Sn sheets that are also stable and the trends of comparable mechanical stability of the planar and buckled phases remain the same."}

  abstract = {Atomically thin boron nitride (BN) is an important 2D nanomaterial, with many properties distinct from graphene. In this feature article, these unique properties and associated applications, often not feasible with graphene, are outlined. The article starts with characterization and identification of atomically thin BN. It is followed by demonstrating their strong oxidation resistance at high temperatures and applications in protecting metals from oxidation and corrosion. As flat insulators, BN nanosheets are ideal dielectric substrates for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and electronic devices based on 2D heterostructures. The light emission of BN nanosheets in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) and ultraviolet (UV) regions is also included for its scientific and technological importance. The last part is dedicated to synthesis, characterization, and optical properties of BN nanoribbons, a special form of nanosheets.}

abstract  ="Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been under scientific investigation for more than fifteen years because of their unique properties that predestine them for many potential applications. The field of nanotechnology and nanoscience push their investigation forward to produce CNTs with suitable parameters for future applications. It is evident that new approaches of their synthesis need to be developed and optimized. In this paper we review history{,} types{,} structure and especially the different synthesis methods for CNTs preparation including arc discharge{,} laser ablation and chemical vapour deposition. Moreover{,} we mention some rarely used ways of arc discharge deposition which involves arc discharge in liquid solutions in contrary to standard used deposition in a gas atmosphere. In addition{,} the methods for uniform vertically aligned CNTs synthesis using lithographic techniques for catalyst deposition as well as a method utilizing a nanoporous anodized aluminium oxide as a pattern for selective CNTs growth are reported too."}

  abstract = {Graphene has been widely heralded over the last decade as one of the most promising nanomaterials for integrated, miniaturized applications spanning from nanoelectronics, interconnections, thermal management, sensing, to optoelectronics. Graphene grown on silicon carbide is currently the most likely candidate to fulfill this promise. As a matter of fact, the capability to synthesize high-quality graphene over large areas using processes and substrates compatible as much as possible with the well-established semiconductor manufacturing technologies is one crucial requirement. We review here, the enormous scientific and technological advances achieved in terms of epitaxial growth of graphene from thermal decomposition of bulk silicon carbide and the fine control of the graphene electronic properties through intercalation. Finally, we discuss perspectives on epitaxial graphene growth from silicon carbide on silicon, a particularly challenging area that could result in maximum benefit for the integration of graphene with silicon technologies.}

abstract ={Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron—electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density ρ. Q[ρ] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Ψρ which yield the fixed. ρ. Q[ρ] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron—electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix γ, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree—Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

The lattice parameters are superior to those predicted by the screened hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof (HSE), and provide a significant improvement over the geometries predicted by typical semilocal functionals, yielding results competitive with PBEsol, which was specially tuned for solids. HISS also yields band gaps superior to those produced by functionals developed specifically for the solid state. Timings indicate that HISS is more computationally efficient than HSE, implying that the high quality lattice constants coupled with improved optical band gap predictions render HISS a useful adjunct to HSE in the modeling of geometry-sensitive semiconductors.}

	abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is now routinely used for simulating material properties. Many software packages are available, which makes it challenging to know which are the best to use for a specific calculation. Lejaeghere et al. compared the calculated values for the equation of states for 71 elemental crystals from 15 different widely used DFT codes employing 40 different potentials (see the Perspective by Skylaris). Although there were variations in the calculated values, most recent codes and methods converged toward a single value, with errors comparable to those of experiment.Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad3000; see also p. 1394INTRODUCTIONThe reproducibility of results is one of the underlying principles of science. An observation can only be accepted by the scientific community when it can be confirmed by independent studies. However, reproducibility does not come easily. Recent works have painfully exposed cases where previous conclusions were not upheld. The scrutiny of the scientific community has also turned to research involving computer programs, finding that reproducibility depends more strongly on implementation than commonly thought. These problems are especially relevant for property predictions of crystals and molecules, which hinge on precise computer implementations of the governing equation of quantum physics.RATIONALEThis work focuses on density functional theory (DFT), a particularly popular quantum method for both academic and industrial applications. More than 15,000 DFT papers are published each year, and DFT is now increasingly used in an automated fashion to build large databases or apply multiscale techniques with limited human supervision. Therefore, the reproducibility of DFT results underlies the scientific credibility of a substantial fraction of current work in the natural and engineering sciences. A plethora of DFT computer codes are available, many of them differing considerably in their details of implementation, and each yielding a certain {\textquotedblleft}precision{\textquotedblright} relative to other codes. How is one to decide for more than a few simple cases which code predicts the correct result, and which does not? We devised a procedure to assess the precision of DFT methods and used this to demonstrate reproducibility among many of the most widely used DFT codes. The essential part of this assessment is a pairwise comparison of a wide range of methods with respect to their predictions of the equations of state of the elemental crystals. This effort required the combined expertise of a large group of code developers and expert users.RESULTSWe calculated equation-of-state data for four classes of DFT implementations, totaling 40 methods. Most codes agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Even in the case of pseudization approaches, which largely depend on the atomic potentials used, a similar precision can be obtained as when using the full potential. The remaining deviations are due to subtle effects, such as specific numerical implementations or the treatment of relativistic terms.CONCLUSIONOur work demonstrates that the precision of DFT implementations can be determined, even in the absence of one absolute reference code. Although this was not the case 5 to 10 years ago, most of the commonly used codes and methods are now found to predict essentially identical results. The established precision of DFT codes not only ensures the reproducibility of DFT predictions but also puts several past and future developments on a firmer footing. Any newly developed methodology can now be tested against the benchmark to verify whether it reaches the same level of precision. New DFT applications can be shown to have used a sufficiently precise method. Moreover, high-precision DFT calculations are essential for developing improvements to DFT methodology, such as new density functionals, which may further increase the predictive power of the simulations.Recent DFT methods yield reproducible results.Whereas older DFT implementations predict different values (red darts), codes have now evolved to mutual agreement (green darts). The scoreboard illustrates the good pairwise agreement of four classes of DFT implementations (horizontal direction) with all-electron results (vertical direction). Each number reflects the average difference between the equations of state for a given pair of methods, with the green-to-red color scheme showing the range from the best to the poorest agreement.The widespread popularity of density functional theory has given rise to an extensive range of dedicated codes for predicting molecular and crystalline properties. However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements.},

abstract ={The massless Dirac spectrum of electrons in single-layer graphene has been thoroughly studied both theoretically and experimentally. Although a subject of considerable theoretical interest, experimental investigations of the richer electronic structure of few-layer graphene (FLG) have been limited. Here we examine FLG graphene crystals with Bernal stacking of layer thicknesses N = 1,2,3,…8 prepared using the mechanical exfoliation technique. For each layer thickness N, infrared conductivity measurements over the spectral range of 0.2–1.0 eV have been performed and reveal a distinctive band structure, with different conductivity peaks present below 0.5 eV and a relatively flat spectrum at higher photon energies. The principal transitions exhibit a systematic energy-scaling behavior with N. These observations are explained within a unified zone-folding scheme that generates the electronic states for all FLG materials from that of the bulk 3D graphite crystal through imposition of appropriate boundary conditions. Using the Kubo formula, we find that the complete infrared conductivity spectra for the different FLG crystals can be reproduced reasonably well within the framework a tight-binding model.},

Although 2D Diracmaterials possess many novel properties and physics, they are rare compared with the numerous 2Dmaterials. To provide explanation for the rarity of 2D Diracmaterials aswell as clues in searching for new Dirac systems, herewe review the recent theoretical aspects of various 2D Diracmaterials, including graphene, silicene, germanene, graphynes, several boron and carbon sheets, transition-metal oxides (VO2)n/(TiO2)m and (CrO2)n/(TiO2)m, organic and organometallic crystals, so-MoS2, and artificial lattices (electron gases and ultracold atoms). Their structural and electronic properties are summarized.Wealso investigate howDirac points emerge, move, and merge in these systems. The vonNeumann–Wigner theorem is used to explain the scarcity of Dirac cones in 2D systems, which leads to rigorous requirements on the symmetry, parameters, Fermi level, and band overlap ofmaterials to achieve Dirac cones. Connections between existence ofDirac cones and the structural features are also discussed.},

abstract  ="The influence of lattice symmetry on the existence of Dirac cones was investigated for two distinct systems: a general two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystal containing two atoms in each unit cell and a 2D electron gas (2DEG) under a periodic muffin-tin potential. A criterion was derived under a tight-binding approximation for the existence of Dirac cones in the atomic crystal. When the transfer hoppings are assumed to be single functions of the distance between atoms{,} it was shown that the probability of observing Dirac cones in the atomic crystal gradually decreases before being reduced to zero when the lattice changes from hexagonal to square. For a 2DEG with full square symmetry{,} a Dirac point exists at the Brillouin zone corners{,} where the energy dispersion is parabolic not linear. These results suggest that conventional Dirac fermions (such as those in graphene) are difficult to achieve in a square lattice with full symmetry (wallpaper group p4mm)."}

abstract = {We show that Clar?s theory of the aromatic sextet is a simple and powerful tool to predict the stability, the $\pi$-electron distribution, the geometry, and the electronic/magnetic structure of graphene nanoribbons with different hydrogen edge terminations. We use density functional theory to obtain the equilibrium atomic positions, simulated scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images, edge energies, band gaps, and edge-induced strains of graphene ribbons that we analyze in terms of Clar formulas. On the basis of their Clar representation, we propose a classification scheme for graphene ribbons that groups configurations with similar bond length alternations, STM patterns, and Raman spectra. Our simulations show how STM images and Raman spectra can be used to identify the type of edge termination.},

@article{Ackland1997,
abstract = {A popular method of extracting phonon frequencies from ab initio calculations is to find the equilibrium structure of a material and then build up the matrix of force constants by calculating forces acting due to small displacements of the atoms. If the range of the force constants is assumed to be short, as it typically is in parametrized force-model calculations, the entire dispersion relation can be evaluated from data taken from small ab initio calculations. In this paper we highlight the practical difficulties introduced by low-symmetry structures with free internal parameters and present practical solutions to them. By way of example, we present a number of calculations where solution of these problems is essential. These include ab initio calculation of phonon dispersion in a non-centrosymmetric structure (silver gallium diselenide) and good agreement between calculations and neutron scattering data for a structure with free internal parameters (germanium sulphide).},

@article{Cai2014a,
abstract = {The anharmonic behavior of phonons and intrinsic thermal conductivity associated with the umklapp scattering in monolayer MoS2 sheet are investigated via first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional perturbation theory. In contrast to the negative Gruneissen parameter (gamma) occurring in low-frequency modes in graphene, positive gamma in the whole Brillouin zone is demonstrated in monolayer MoS2 with much larger gamma for acoustic modes than that for the optical modes, suggesting that monolayer MoS2 sheet possesses a positive coefficient of thermal expansion. The calculated phonon lifetimes of the infrared active modes are 5.50 and 5.72 ps for E' and A(2)'', respectively, in good agreement with experimental results obtained by fitting the dielectric oscillators with the infrared reflectivity spectrum. The lifetime of the Raman A(1)' mode (38.36 ps) is about seven times longer than those of the infrared modes. The dominated phonon mean free path of monolayer MoS2 is less than 20 nm, about 30-fold smaller than that of graphene. Combined with the nonequilibrium Green's function calculations, the room temperature thermal conductivity of monolayer MoS2 is found to be around 23.2 Wm(-1) K-1, two orders of magnitude lower than that of graphene.},

In this Review, we first discuss the optical properties and applications of various two-dimensional materials, and then cover two different approaches for enhancing their interactions with light: through their integration with external photonic structures, and through intrinsic polaritonic resonances. Finally, we present a narrow-bandgap layered material [mdash] black phosphorus [mdash] that serendipitously bridges the energy gap between the zero-bandgap graphene and the relatively large-bandgap transition metal dichalcogenides. The plethora of two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures, together with the array of available approaches for enhancing the light-matter interaction, offers the promise of scientific discoveries and nanophotonics technologies across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum.},

@article{Zhu2014a,
abstract = {Piezoelectricity allows precise and robust conversion between electricity and mechanical force, and arises from the broken inversion symmetry in the atomic structure. Reducing the dimensionality of bulk materials has been suggested to enhance piezoelectricity. However, when the thickness of a material approaches a single molecular layer, the large surface energy can cause piezoelectric structures to be thermodynamically unstable. Transition-metal dichalcogenides can retain their atomic structures down to the single-layer limit without lattice reconstruction, even under ambient conditions. Recent calculations have predicted the existence of piezoelectricity in these two-dimensional crystals due to their broken inversion symmetry. Here, we report experimental evidence of piezoelectricity in a free-standing single layer of molybdenum disulphide (MoS₂) and a measured piezoelectric coefficient of e₁₁ = 2.9 × 10(-10) C m(-1). The measurement of the intrinsic piezoelectricity in such free-standing crystals is free from substrate effects such as doping and parasitic charges. We observed a finite and zero piezoelectric response in MoS₂ in odd and even number of layers, respectively, in sharp contrast to bulk piezoelectric materials. This oscillation is due to the breaking and recovery of the inversion symmetry of the two-dimensional crystal. Through the angular dependence of electromechanical coupling, we determined the two-dimensional crystal orientation. The piezoelectricity discovered in this single molecular membrane promises new applications in low-power logic switches for computing and ultrasensitive biological sensors scaled down to a single atomic unit cell.},

abstract="It is found that several layer-phase group-III monochalcogenides, including GaS, GaSe, and InSe, are piezoelectric in their monolayer form. First-principles calculations reveal that the piezoelectric coefficients of monolayer GaS, GaSe, and InSe (2.06, 2.30, and 1.46 pm{\textperiodcentered}V{\texttrademark}1) are of the same order of magnitude as previously discovered two-dimensional (2D) piezoelectric materials such as boron nitride (BN) and MoS2 monolayers. This study therefore indicates that a strong piezoelectric response can be obtained in a wide range of two-dimensional materials with broken inversion symmetry. The co-existence of piezoelectricity and superior photo-sensitivity in these monochalcogenide monolayer semiconductors means they have the potential to allow for the integration of electromechanical and optical sensors on the same material platform.",

abstract  ="The structural and mechanical properties of graphene-like honeycomb monolayer structures of MoS2 (g-MoS2) under various large strains are investigated using density functional theory (DFT). g-MoS2 is mechanically stable and can sustain extra large strains: the ultimate strains are 0.24{,} 0.37{,} and 0.26 for armchair{,} zigzag{,} and biaxial deformation{,} respectively. The in-plane stiffness is as high as 120 N m-1 (184 GPa equivalently). The third{,} fourth{,} and fifth order elastic constants are indispensable for accurate modeling of the mechanical properties under strains larger than 0.04{,} 0.07{,} and 0.13 respectively. The second order elastic constants{,} including in-plane stiffness{,} are predicted to monotonically increase with pressure while the Poisson ratio monotonically decreases with increasing pressure. With the prominent mechanical properties including large ultimate strains and in-plane stiffness{,} g-MoS2 is a promising candidate of elastic energy storage for clean energy. It possesses a theoretical energy storage capacity as high as 8.8 MJ L-1 and 1.7 MJ kg-1{,} or 476 W h kg-1{,} larger than a Li-ion battery and is environmentally friendly."}

abstract  ="Using density functional theory in combination with the nonequilibrium Green{'}s function formalism we study the electronic transport properties{,} optical properties and atomic partial charges of the recently proposed isostructural materials: penta-graphene (PG){,} pentagonal silicon dicarbide (p-SiC2) and pentagonal carbon nitride (p-CN2). Enhanced electronic transport is obtained in p-SiC2 as compared to PG due to the delocalization of the electronic states and smaller variations of the electrostatic potential. This enhancement occurs despite a smaller contribution of Si atoms to the density of states of the system. Penta-SiC2 also displays improved dielectric and optical properties as compared to its all-carbon analogue. For example{,} larger absorption is obtained in both the visible and the ultraviolet spectral ranges. Strong variation in the atomic partial charge distribution was found in p-SiC2. On the contrary{,} p-CN2 was not found to exhibit improved optoelectronic properties compared to PG{,} except for larger partial charges on the surface of the sample. Our findings demonstrate the potential of p-SiC2 in optoelectronic applications."}

  abstract={One of the fascinating properties of the new families of two-dimensional crystals is their high stretchability and the possibility to use external strain to manipulate, in a controlled manner, their optical and electronic properties. Strain engineering, understood as the field that study how the physical properties of materials can be tuned by controlling the elastic strain fields applied to it, has a perfect platform for its implementation in the atomically thin semiconducting materials. The object of this review is to give an overview of the recent progress to control the optical and electronics properties of 2D crystals, by means of strain engineering. We will concentrate on semiconducting layered materials, with especial emphasis in transition metal dichalcogenides (MoS 2 , WS 2 , MoSe 2 and WSe 2 ). The effect of strain in other atomically thin materials like black phosphorus, silicene, etc, is also considered. The benefits of strain engineering in 2D crystals for applications in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics will be revised, and the open problems in the field will be discussed.}

abstract="The pressure responses of portlandite and the isotope effect on the phase transition were investigated at room temperature from single-crystal Raman and IR spectra and from powder X-ray diffraction using diamond anvil cells under quasi-hydrostatic conditions in a helium pressure-transmitting medium. Phase transformation and subsequent peak broadening (partial amorphization) observed from the Raman and IR spectra of Ca(OH)2 occurred at lower pressures than those of Ca(OD)2. In contrast, no isotope effect was found on the volume and axial compressions observed from powder X-ray diffraction patterns. X-ray diffraction lines attributable to the high-pressure phase remained up to 28.5 GPa, suggesting no total amorphization in a helium pressure medium within the examined pressure region. These results suggest that the H--D isotope effect is engendered in the local environment surrounding H(D) atoms. Moreover, the ratio of sample-to-methanol--ethanol pressure medium (i.e., packing density) in the sample chamber had a significant effect on the increase in the half widths of the diffraction lines, even at pressures below the hydrostatic limit of the pressure medium.",
