  Abstract                 = {A popular method of extracting phonon frequencies from ab initio calculations is to find the equilibrium structure of a material and then build up the matrix of force constants by calculating forces acting due to small displacements of the atoms. If the range of the force constants is assumed to be short, as it typically is in parametrized force-model calculations, the entire dispersion relation can be evaluated from data taken from small ab initio calculations. In this paper we highlight the practical difficulties introduced by low-symmetry structures with free internal parameters and present practical solutions to them. By way of example, we present a number of calculations where solution of these problems is essential. These include ab initio calculation of phonon dispersion in a non-centrosymmetric structure (silver gallium diselenide) and good agreement between calculations and neutron scattering data for a structure with free internal parameters (germanium sulphide).},

  Abstract                 = {Strain engineering is an effective way to tune the intrinsic properties of a material. Here{,} we show by using first-principles calculations that both uniaxial and biaxial tensile strain applied to monolayer TiS3 are able to significantly modify its intrinsic mobility. From the elastic modulus and the phonon dispersion relation we determine the tensile strain range where structure dynamical stability of the monolayer is guaranteed. Within this region{,} we find more than one order of enhancement of the acoustic phonon limited mobility at 300 K (100 K){,} i.e. from 1.71 [times] 104 (5.13 [times] 104) cm2 V-1 s-1 to 5.53 [times] 105 (1.66 [times] 106) cm2 V-1 s-1. The degree of anisotropy in both mobility and effective mass can be tuned by using tensile strain. Furthermore{,} we can either increase or decrease the band gap of TiS3 monolayer by applying strain along different crystal directions. This property allows us to use TiS3 not only in electronic but also in optical applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently penta-graphene was proposed as a stable two-dimensional carbon allotrope consisting of a single layer of interconnected carbon pentagons [Zhang et al.{,} PNAS{,} 2015{,} 112{,} 2372]. Its silicon counterpart{,} penta-silicene{,} however{,} is not stable. In this work{,} we show that multilayers of penta-silicene form stable materials with semiconducting or metallic properties{,} depending on the stacking mode. We demonstrate their dynamic stability through their phonon spectrum and using molecular dynamics. A particular type of bilayer penta-silicene is found to have lower energy than all of the known hexagonal silicene bilayers and forms therefore the most stable bilayer silicon material predicted so far. The electronic and mechanical properties of these new silicon allotropes are studied in detail and their behavior under strain is investigated. We demonstrate that strain can be used to tune its band gap.},

  Abstract                 = {The anharmonic behavior of phonons and intrinsic thermal conductivity associated with the umklapp scattering in monolayer MoS2 sheet are investigated via first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional perturbation theory. In contrast to the negative Gruneissen parameter (gamma) occurring in low-frequency modes in graphene, positive gamma in the whole Brillouin zone is demonstrated in monolayer MoS2 with much larger gamma for acoustic modes than that for the optical modes, suggesting that monolayer MoS2 sheet possesses a positive coefficient of thermal expansion. The calculated phonon lifetimes of the infrared active modes are 5.50 and 5.72 ps for E' and A(2)'', respectively, in good agreement with experimental results obtained by fitting the dielectric oscillators with the infrared reflectivity spectrum. The lifetime of the Raman A(1)' mode (38.36 ps) is about seven times longer than those of the infrared modes. The dominated phonon mean free path of monolayer MoS2 is less than 20 nm, about 30-fold smaller than that of graphene. Combined with the nonequilibrium Green's function calculations, the room temperature thermal conductivity of monolayer MoS2 is found to be around 23.2 Wm(-1) K-1, two orders of magnitude lower than that of graphene.},

  Abstract                 = {The adsorption and diffusion of Li{,} Na{,} K and Ca atoms on a Mo2C monolayer are systematically investigated by using first principles methods. We found that the considered metal atoms are strongly bound to the Mo2C monolayer. However{,} the adsorption energies of these alkali and earth alkali elements decrease as the coverage increases due to the enhanced repulsion between the metal ions. We predict a significant charge transfer from the ad-atoms to the Mo2C monolayer{,} which indicates clearly the cationic state of the metal atoms. The metallic character of both pristine and doped Mo2C ensures a good electronic conduction that is essential for an optimal anode material. Low migration energy barriers are predicted as small as 43 meV for Li{,} 19 meV for Na and 15 meV for K{,} which result in the very fast diffusion of these atoms on Mo2C. For Mo2C{,} we found a storage capacity larger than 400 mA h g-1 by the inclusion of multilayer adsorption. Mo2C expands slightly upon deposition of Li and Na even at high concentrations{,} which ensures the good cyclic stability of the atomic layer. The calculated average voltage of 0.68 V for Li and 0.30 V for Na ions makes Mo2C attractive for low charging voltage applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Although graphite is known as one of the most chemically inert materials, we have found that graphene, a single atomic plane of graphite, can react with atomic hydrogen, which transforms this highly conductive zero-overlap semimetal into an insulator. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the obtained graphene derivative (graphane) is crystalline and retains the hexagonal lattice, but its period becomes markedly shorter than that of graphene. The reaction with hydrogen is reversible, so that the original metallic state, the lattice spacing, and even the quantum Hall effect can be restored by annealing. Our work illustrates the concept of graphene as a robust atomic-scale scaffold on the basis of which new two-dimensional crystals with designed electronic and other properties can be created by attaching other atoms and molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {We review transport experiments on graphene quantum dots and narrow graphene constrictions. In a quantum dot, electrons are confined in all lateral dimensions, offering the possibility for detailed investigation and controlled manipulation of individual quantum systems. The recently isolated two-dimensional carbon allotrope graphene is an interesting host to study quantum phenomena, due to its novel electronic properties and the expected weak interaction of the electron spin with the material. Graphene quantum dots are fabricated by etching mono-layer flakes into small islands (diameter 60-350 nm) with narrow connections to contacts (width 20-75 nm), serving as tunneling barriers for transport spectroscopy. Electron confinement in graphene quantum dots is observed by measuring Coulomb blockade and transport through excited states, a manifestation of quantum confinement. Measurements in a magnetic field perpendicular to the sample plane allowed to identify the regime with only a few charge carriers in the dot (electron-hole transition), and the crossover to the formation of the graphene specific zero-energy Landau level at high fields. After rotation of the sample into parallel magnetic field orientation, Zeeman spin splitting with a g -factor of g $\approx$ 2 is measured. The filling sequence of subsequent spin states is similar to what was found in GaAs and related to the non-negligible influence of exchange interactions among the electrons.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a great desire to develop the high- efficient anodes materials for Li batteries, which require not only large capacity but also high stability and mobility. In this work, the phosphorene/graphene heterostructure (P/G) was carefully explored based on first-principles calculations. The binding energy of Li on the pristine phosphorene is relatively weak (within 1.9 eV), whereas the phosphorene/graphene hetero- structure (P/G) can greatly improve the binding energy (2.6 eV) without affecting the high mobility of Li within the layers. The electronic structures show that the large Li adsorption energy and fast diffusion ability of the P/G origin from the interfacial synergy effect. Interestingly, the P/G also displays ultrahigh stiffness (Cac = 350 N/m, Czz = 464 N/m), which can effectively avoid the distortion of the pristine phosphorene after the insertion of lithium. Thus, P/G can greatly enhance the cycle life of the battery. Owing to the high capacity, good conductivity, excellent Li mobility, and ultrahigh stiffness, P/G is a very promising anode material in Li-ion batteries (LIBs). T},

  Abstract                 = {The pressure responses of portlandite and the isotope effect on the phase transition were investigated at room temperature from single-crystal Raman and IR spectra and from powder X-ray diffraction using diamond anvil cells under quasi-hydrostatic conditions in a helium pressure-transmitting medium. Phase transformation and subsequent peak broadening (partial amorphization) observed from the Raman and IR spectra of Ca(OH)2 occurred at lower pressures than those of Ca(OD)2. In contrast, no isotope effect was found on the volume and axial compressions observed from powder X-ray diffraction patterns. X-ray diffraction lines attributable to the high-pressure phase remained up to 28.5 GPa, suggesting no total amorphization in a helium pressure medium within the examined pressure region. These results suggest that the H--D isotope effect is engendered in the local environment surrounding H(D) atoms. Moreover, the ratio of sample-to-methanol--ethanol pressure medium (i.e., packing density) in the sample chamber had a significant effect on the increase in the half widths of the diffraction lines, even at pressures below the hydrostatic limit of the pressure medium.},

  Abstract                 = {We measured the elastic properties and intrinsic breaking strength of free-standing monolayer graphene membranes by nanoindentation in an atomic force microscope. The force-displacement behavior is interpreted within a framework of nonlinear elastic stress-strain response, and yields second- and third-order elastic stiffnesses of 340 newtons per meter (N m{\textendash}1) and {\textendash}690 Nm{\textendash}1, respectively. The breaking strength is 42 N m{\textendash}1 and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young{\textquoteright}s modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = {\textendash}2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of $\sigma$int = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an exhaustive first-principles investigation of Li absorption and intercalation in single layer graphene and few layer graphene, as compared to bulk graphite. For single layer graphene, the cluster expansion method is used to systemically search for the lowest energy ionic configuration as a function of absorbed Li content. It is predicted that there exists no Li arrangement that stabilizes Li absorption on the surface of single layer graphene unless that surface includes defects. From this result follows that defect-poor single layer graphene exhibits significantly inferior capacity compared to bulk graphite. For few layer graphene, we calibrate a semiempirical potential to include the effect of van der Waals interactions, which is essential to account for the contribution of empty (no Li) gallery to the total energy. We identify and analyze the Li intercalation mechanisms in few layer graphene and map out the sequence in stable phases as we move from single layer graphene, through few layer, to bulk graphite.},

  Abstract                 = {Density functional theory (DFT) is now routinely used for simulating material properties. Many software packages are available, which makes it challenging to know which are the best to use for a specific calculation. Lejaeghere et al. compared the calculated values for the equation of states for 71 elemental crystals from 15 different widely used DFT codes employing 40 different potentials (see the Perspective by Skylaris). Although there were variations in the calculated values, most recent codes and methods converged toward a single value, with errors comparable to those of experiment.Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad3000; see also p. 1394INTRODUCTIONThe reproducibility of results is one of the underlying principles of science. An observation can only be accepted by the scientific community when it can be confirmed by independent studies. However, reproducibility does not come easily. Recent works have painfully exposed cases where previous conclusions were not upheld. The scrutiny of the scientific community has also turned to research involving computer programs, finding that reproducibility depends more strongly on implementation than commonly thought. These problems are especially relevant for property predictions of crystals and molecules, which hinge on precise computer implementations of the governing equation of quantum physics.RATIONALEThis work focuses on density functional theory (DFT), a particularly popular quantum method for both academic and industrial applications. More than 15,000 DFT papers are published each year, and DFT is now increasingly used in an automated fashion to build large databases or apply multiscale techniques with limited human supervision. Therefore, the reproducibility of DFT results underlies the scientific credibility of a substantial fraction of current work in the natural and engineering sciences. A plethora of DFT computer codes are available, many of them differing considerably in their details of implementation, and each yielding a certain {\textquotedblleft}precision{\textquotedblright} relative to other codes. How is one to decide for more than a few simple cases which code predicts the correct result, and which does not? We devised a procedure to assess the precision of DFT methods and used this to demonstrate reproducibility among many of the most widely used DFT codes. The essential part of this assessment is a pairwise comparison of a wide range of methods with respect to their predictions of the equations of state of the elemental crystals. This effort required the combined expertise of a large group of code developers and expert users.RESULTSWe calculated equation-of-state data for four classes of DFT implementations, totaling 40 methods. Most codes agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Even in the case of pseudization approaches, which largely depend on the atomic potentials used, a similar precision can be obtained as when using the full potential. The remaining deviations are due to subtle effects, such as specific numerical implementations or the treatment of relativistic terms.CONCLUSIONOur work demonstrates that the precision of DFT implementations can be determined, even in the absence of one absolute reference code. Although this was not the case 5 to 10 years ago, most of the commonly used codes and methods are now found to predict essentially identical results. The established precision of DFT codes not only ensures the reproducibility of DFT predictions but also puts several past and future developments on a firmer footing. Any newly developed methodology can now be tested against the benchmark to verify whether it reaches the same level of precision. New DFT applications can be shown to have used a sufficiently precise method. Moreover, high-precision DFT calculations are essential for developing improvements to DFT methodology, such as new density functionals, which may further increase the predictive power of the simulations.Recent DFT methods yield reproducible results.Whereas older DFT implementations predict different values (red darts), codes have now evolved to mutual agreement (green darts). The scoreboard illustrates the good pairwise agreement of four classes of DFT implementations (horizontal direction) with all-electron results (vertical direction). Each number reflects the average difference between the equations of state for a given pair of methods, with the green-to-red color scheme showing the range from the best to the poorest agreement.The widespread popularity of density functional theory has given rise to an extensive range of dedicated codes for predicting molecular and crystalline properties. However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements.},

  Abstract                 = {Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron---electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density $\rho$. Q[$\rho$] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions {$\Psi$}$\rho$ which yield the fixed. $\rho$. Q[$\rho$] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron---electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix $\gamma$, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree---Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

It is followed by demonstrating their strong oxidation resistance at high temperatures and applications in protecting metals from oxidation and corrosion. As flat insulators, BN nanosheets are ideal dielectric substrates for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and electronic devices based on 2D heterostructures. The light emission of BN nanosheets in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) and ultraviolet (UV) regions is also included for its scientific and technological importance. The last part is dedicated to synthesis, characterization, and optical properties of BN nanoribbons, a special form of nanosheets.},

This study therefore indicates that a strong piezoelectric response can be obtained in a wide range of two-dimensional materials with broken inversion symmetry. The co-existence of piezoelectricity and superior photo-sensitivity in these monochalcogenide monolayer semiconductors means they have the potential to allow for the integration of electromechanical and optical sensors on the same material platform.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of lattice symmetry on the existence of Dirac cones was investigated for two distinct systems: a general two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystal containing two atoms in each unit cell and a 2D electron gas (2DEG) under a periodic muffin-tin potential. A criterion was derived under a tight-binding approximation for the existence of Dirac cones in the atomic crystal. When the transfer hoppings are assumed to be single functions of the distance between atoms{,} it was shown that the probability of observing Dirac cones in the atomic crystal gradually decreases before being reduced to zero when the lattice changes from hexagonal to square. For a 2DEG with full square symmetry{,} a Dirac point exists at the Brillouin zone corners{,} where the energy dispersion is parabolic not linear. These results suggest that conventional Dirac fermions (such as those in graphene) are difficult to achieve in a square lattice with full symmetry (wallpaper group p4mm).},

The lattice parameters are superior to those predicted by the screened hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof (HSE), and provide a significant improvement over the geometries predicted by typical semilocal functionals, yielding results competitive with PBEsol, which was specially tuned for solids. HISS also yields band gaps superior to those produced by functionals developed specifically for the solid state. Timings indicate that HISS is more computationally efficient than HSE, implying that the high quality lattice constants coupled with improved optical band gap predictions render HISS a useful adjunct to HSE in the modeling of geometry-sensitive semiconductors.},

  Abstract                 = {The massless Dirac spectrum of electrons in single-layer graphene has been thoroughly studied both theoretically and experimentally. Although a subject of considerable theoretical interest, experimental investigations of the richer electronic structure of few-layer graphene (FLG) have been limited. Here we examine FLG graphene crystals with Bernal stacking of layer thicknesses N = 1,2,3,{\ldots}8 prepared using the mechanical exfoliation technique. For each layer thickness N, infrared conductivity measurements over the spectral range of 0.2--1.0 eV have been performed and reveal a distinctive band structure, with different conductivity peaks present below 0.5 eV and a relatively flat spectrum at higher photon energies. The principal transitions exhibit a systematic energy-scaling behavior with N. These observations are explained within a unified zone-folding scheme that generates the electronic states for all FLG materials from that of the bulk 3D graphite crystal through imposition of appropriate boundary conditions. Using the Kubo formula, we find that the complete infrared conductivity spectra for the different FLG crystals can be reproduced reasonably well within the framework a tight-binding model.},

  Abstract                 = {Silicene{,} a graphene analogue of silicon{,} has been generating immense interest due to its potential for applications in miniaturized devices. Unlike planar graphene{,} silicene prefers a buckled structure. Here we explore the possibility of stabilizing the planar form of silicene by Ni doping using first principles density functional theory based calculations. It is found that planar as well as buckled structure is stable for Ni-doped silicene{,} but the buckled sheet has slightly lower total energy. The planar silicene sheet has unstable phonon modes. A comparative study of the mechanical properties reveals that the in-plane stiffness of both the pristine and the doped planar silicene is higher compared to that of the buckled silicene. This suggests that planar silicene is mechanically more robust. Electronic structure calculations of the planar and buckled Ni-doped silicene show that the energy bands at the Dirac point transform from linear behavior to parabolic dispersion. Furthermore{,} we extend our study to Ge and Sn sheets that are also stable and the trends of comparable mechanical stability of the planar and buckled phases remain the same.},

  Abstract                 = {Si nanosheets are a promising candidate material for nanoscale devices but a thorough understanding of their surface properties is still lacking. Here we find, using first-principles molecular-dynamics calculations, a new surface structure specific to a double-layer Si nanosheet. The new surface structure, which can be labeled as Si(1 1 1)-2 x 2 in the same fashion as the bulk Si surface, is formed during surface reconstruction at finite temperature. The reconstructed nanosheet surface consists of highly distorted tetrahedra as on the Si(1 1 1)-2 x 1 surface, but its electronic band structure is markedly different from that of Si(1 1 1)-2 x 1. The vibrational properties of the reconstructed Si nanosheet are also found to reflect the distortion in the tetrahedral order. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

By using micromechanical cleavage, we have prepared and studied a variety of 2D crystals including single layers of boron nitride, graphite, several dichalcogenides, and complex oxides. These atomically thin sheets (essentially gigantic 2D molecules unprotected from the immediate environment) are stable under ambient conditions, exhibit high crystal quality, and are continuous on a macroscopic scale.},

  Abstract                 = {The quantum Hall effect (QHE), one example of a quantum phenomenon that occurs on a truly macroscopic scale, has attracted intense interest since its discovery in 1980 and has helped elucidate many important aspects of quantum physics. It has also led to the establishment of a new metrological standard, the resistance quantum. Disappointingly, however, the QHE has been observed only at liquid-helium temperatures. We show that in graphene, in a single atomic layer of carbon, the QHE can be measured reliably even at room temperature, which makes possible QHE resistance standards becoming available to a broader community, outside a few national institutions.},

  Abstract                 = {The structural and mechanical properties of graphene-like honeycomb monolayer structures of MoS2 (g-MoS2) under various large strains are investigated using density functional theory (DFT). g-MoS2 is mechanically stable and can sustain extra large strains: the ultimate strains are 0.24{,} 0.37{,} and 0.26 for armchair{,} zigzag{,} and biaxial deformation{,} respectively. The in-plane stiffness is as high as 120 N m-1 (184 GPa equivalently). The third{,} fourth{,} and fifth order elastic constants are indispensable for accurate modeling of the mechanical properties under strains larger than 0.04{,} 0.07{,} and 0.13 respectively. The second order elastic constants{,} including in-plane stiffness{,} are predicted to monotonically increase with pressure while the Poisson ratio monotonically decreases with increasing pressure. With the prominent mechanical properties including large ultimate strains and in-plane stiffness{,} g-MoS2 is a promising candidate of elastic energy storage for clean energy. It possesses a theoretical energy storage capacity as high as 8.8 MJ L-1 and 1.7 MJ kg-1{,} or 476 W h kg-1{,} larger than a Li-ion battery and is environmentally friendly.},

This tutorial review outlines the theory and practice of modeling stereoselective reactions. Recent examples illustrate how an understanding of the fundamental principles and the application of state-of-the-art computational methods may be used to gain mechanistic insight into organic and organometallic reactions. We highlight the emerging potential of this computational tool-box in providing meaningful predictions for the rational design of asymmetric catalysts.

They are being integrated into smart electronics, textiles, the Internet of Things, and electric vehi-cles, transforming our lifestyle. Large-scale battery-based energy storage is helping to improve the intermittency problems with renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and waves. However, current Li-ion batteries by and large cannot be charged rapidly and efficiently; they degrade quickly and have to be replaced after only hundreds of cycles 1--3 . Their energy density needs to be improved. Many electrode materials have been proposed for high-performing Li-ion batteries and emerging beyond Li-ion energy storage devices. However, some intrinsic problems still exist. High power density can only be achieved in systems with rapid ion and electron transport 4 , but the movement of ions in bulk electrodes is often restricted due to the limited lattice space, leading to slow charge--discharge processes and fast electrode failure. Poor elec-tronic conductivity of common battery cathode materials (oxides) limits the rate performance further 5 . High energy density requires maximization of the charge storage capability, but conventional materials offer a finite number of sites for ion intercalation and their surface cannot be used to substantially increase charge stor-age capacity. In many cases, electrode materials are subject to phase transformations resulting in the formation of redox inac-tive phases and capacity drop. Another problem is electrode expansion and contraction that accompanies reversible intercala-tion of ions. Volume changes may result in cracking of the grains and delamination from the current collector, leading to capacity decrease (Fig. 1). As a result, phase transformations and mechani-cal degradation of electrode materials severely limit the lifetime of batteries 6},

  Abstract                 = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been under scientific investigation for more than fifteen years because of their unique properties that predestine them for many potential applications. The field of nanotechnology and nanoscience push their investigation forward to produce CNTs with suitable parameters for future applications. It is evident that new approaches of their synthesis need to be developed and optimized. In this paper we review history{,} types{,} structure and especially the different synthesis methods for CNTs preparation including arc discharge{,} laser ablation and chemical vapour deposition. Moreover{,} we mention some rarely used ways of arc discharge deposition which involves arc discharge in liquid solutions in contrary to standard used deposition in a gas atmosphere. In addition{,} the methods for uniform vertically aligned CNTs synthesis using lithographic techniques for catalyst deposition as well as a method utilizing a nanoporous anodized aluminium oxide as a pattern for selective CNTs growth are reported too.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the fascinating properties of the new families of two-dimensional crystals is their high stretchability and the possibility to use external strain to manipulate, in a controlled manner, their optical and electronic properties. Strain engineering, understood as the field that study how the physical properties of materials can be tuned by controlling the elastic strain fields applied to it, has a perfect platform for its implementation in the atomically thin semiconducting materials. The object of this review is to give an overview of the recent progress to control the optical and electronics properties of 2D crystals, by means of strain engineering. We will concentrate on semiconducting layered materials, with especial emphasis in transition metal dichalcogenides (MoS 2 , WS 2 , MoSe 2 and WSe 2 ). The effect of strain in other atomically thin materials like black phosphorus, silicene, etc, is also considered. The benefits of strain engineering in 2D crystals for applications in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics will be revised, and the open problems in the field will be discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Density functional theory (DFT) computations were performed to investigate the electronic properties and Li storage capability of Ti(3)C(2), one representative MXene (M represents transition metals, and X is either C or/and N) material, and its fluorinated and hydroxylated derivatives. The Ti(3)C(2) monolayer acts as a magnetic metal, while its derived Ti(3)C(2)F(2) and Ti(3)C(2)(OH)(2) in their stable conformations are semiconductors with small band gaps. Li adsorption forms a strong Coulomb interaction with Ti(3)C(2)-based hosts but well preserves its structural integrity. The bare Ti(3)C(2) monolayer exhibits a low barrier for Li diffusion and high Li storage capacity (up to Ti(3)C(2)Li(2) stoichiometry). The surface functionalization of F and OH blocks Li transport and decreases Li storage capacity, which should be avoided in experiments. The exceptional properties, including good electronic conductivity, fast Li diffusion, low operating voltage, and high theoretical Li storage capacity, make Ti(3)C(2) MXene a promising anode material for Li ion batteries.},

  Abstract                 = {Inspired by the great development of graphene, more and more research has been conducted to seek new two-dimensional (2D) materialswith Dirac cones. Although 2D Diracmaterials possess many novel properties and physics, they are rare compared with the numerous 2Dmaterials. To provide explanation for the rarity of 2D Diracmaterials aswell as clues in searching for new Dirac systems, herewe review the recent theoretical aspects of various 2D Diracmaterials, including graphene, silicene, germanene, graphynes, several boron and carbon sheets, transition-metal oxides (VO2)n/(TiO2)m and (CrO2)n/(TiO2)m, organic and organometallic crystals, so-MoS2, and artificial lattices (electron gases and ultracold atoms). Their structural and electronic properties are summarized.Wealso investigate howDirac points emerge, move, and merge in these systems. The vonNeumann--Wigner theorem is used to explain the scarcity of Dirac cones in 2D systems, which leads to rigorous requirements on the symmetry, parameters, Fermi level, and band overlap ofmaterials to achieve Dirac cones. Connections between existence ofDirac cones and the structural features are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Integration of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials and their composites into energy storage devices{,} especially rechargeable batteries{,} offers opportunities to timely tackle the challenges of ever growing clean and sustainable energy demands. Therefore{,} it is crucial to design hybrid 2D electrode materials for high performance rechargeable batteries and to fundamentally understand their storage mechanisms at the atomic or nanoscopic levels. This review firstly describes some of the exciting progress achieved in the economic production of graphenes{,} 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs){,} and their composites. Then we survey the recent developments in their electrochemical energy storage pathways and present the associated three kinds of storage mechanisms. In addition{,} we highlight the uncovered structure-performance relationships while utilizing advanced microscopic techniques{,} such as in situ high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and spherical aberration-corrected scanning TEM (STEM){,} both leading to deep unveiling and understanding of the atomic-scale ion storage/release mechanisms and hence providing clear guidance for designing optimized 2D nanostructured electrode materials. Finally{,} the major challenges and opportunities that researchers have to face in this field are outlined. We hope that this review can deepen the Chemical and Material Science Communities{'} understanding of this field and thus effectively contribute to the smart design of future-generation 2D nanostructured electrodes and exploitation of their microscopic mechanisms toward novel high-performance rechargeable batteries.},

We use density functional theory to obtain the equilibrium atomic positions, simulated scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images, edge energies, band gaps, and edge-induced strains of graphene ribbons that we analyze in terms of Clar formulas. On the basis of their Clar representation, we propose a classification scheme for graphene ribbons that groups configurations with similar bond length alternations, STM patterns, and Raman spectra. Our simulations show how STM images and Raman spectra can be used to identify the type of edge termination.},

Finally, we present a narrow-bandgap layered material [mdash] black phosphorus [mdash] that serendipitously bridges the energy gap between the zero-bandgap graphene and the relatively large-bandgap transition metal dichalcogenides. The plethora of two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures, together with the array of available approaches for enhancing the light-matter interaction, offers the promise of scientific discoveries and nanophotonics technologies across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum.},

  Abstract                 = {A combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments is used to shed light on the relation between surface structure and Li-ion storage capacities of the following functionalized two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides or MXenes: Sc2C, Ti2C, Ti3C2, V2C, Cr2C, and Nb2C. The Li-ion storage capacities are found to strongly depend on the nature of the surface functional groups, with O groups exhibiting the highest theoretical Li-ion storage capacities. MXene surfaces can be initially covered with OH groups, removable by high-temperature treatment or by reactions in the first lithiation cycle. This was verified by annealing f-Nb2C and f-Ti3C2 at 673 and 773 K in vacuum for 40 h and in situ X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Li capacity measurements for the first lithiation/delithiation cycle of f-Ti3C2. The high-temperature removal of water and OH was confirmed using X-ray diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering. The voltage profile and X-ray adsorption near edge structure of f-Ti3C2 revealed surface reactions in the first lithiation cycle. Moreover, lithiated oxygen terminated MXenes surfaces are able to adsorb additional Li beyond a monolayer, providing a mechanism to substantially increase capacity, as observed mainly in delaminated MXenes and confirmed by DFT calculations and XAS. The calculated Li diffusion barriers are low, indicative of the measured high-rate performance. We predict the not yet synthesized Cr2C to possess high Li capacity due to the low activation energy of water formation at high temperature, while the not yet synthesized Sc2C is predicted to potentially display low Li capacity due to higher reaction barriers for OH removal.},
