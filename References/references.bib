abstract = {Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

The breaking strength is 42 N m{\textendash}1 and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young{\textquoteright}s modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = {\textendash}2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of σint = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite.

  abstract={We review transport experiments on graphene quantum dots and narrow graphene constrictions. In a quantum dot, electrons are confined in all lateral dimensions, offering the possibility for detailed investigation and controlled manipulation of individual quantum systems. The recently isolated two-dimensional carbon allotrope graphene is an interesting host to study quantum phenomena, due to its novel electronic properties and the expected weak interaction of the electron spin with the material. Graphene quantum dots are fabricated by etching mono-layer flakes into small islands (diameter 60-350 nm) with narrow connections to contacts (width 20-75 nm), serving as tunneling barriers for transport spectroscopy. Electron confinement in graphene quantum dots is observed by measuring Coulomb blockade and transport through excited states, a manifestation of quantum confinement. Measurements in a magnetic field perpendicular to the sample plane allowed to identify the regime with only a few charge carriers in the dot (electron-hole transition), and the crossover to the formation of the graphene specific zero-energy Landau level at high fields. After rotation of the sample into parallel magnetic field orientation, Zeeman spin splitting with a g -factor of g ≈ 2 is measured. The filling sequence of subsequent spin states is similar to what was found in GaAs and related to the non-negligible influence of exchange interactions among the electrons.}

Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the obtained graphene derivative (graphane) is crystalline and retains the hexagonal lattice, but its period becomes markedly shorter than that of graphene. The reaction with hydrogen is reversible, so that the original metallic state, the lattice spacing, and even the quantum Hall effect can be restored by annealing. Our work illustrates the concept of graphene as a robust atomic-scale scaffold on the basis of which new two-dimensional crystals with designed electronic and other properties can be created by attaching other atoms and molecules.},

abstract  ="Silicene{,} a graphene analogue of silicon{,} has been generating immense interest due to its potential for applications in miniaturized devices. Unlike planar graphene{,} silicene prefers a buckled structure. Here we explore the possibility of stabilizing the planar form of silicene by Ni doping using first principles density functional theory based calculations. It is found that planar as well as buckled structure is stable for Ni-doped silicene{,} but the buckled sheet has slightly lower total energy. The planar silicene sheet has unstable phonon modes. A comparative study of the mechanical properties reveals that the in-plane stiffness of both the pristine and the doped planar silicene is higher compared to that of the buckled silicene. This suggests that planar silicene is mechanically more robust. Electronic structure calculations of the planar and buckled Ni-doped silicene show that the energy bands at the Dirac point transform from linear behavior to parabolic dispersion. Furthermore{,} we extend our study to Ge and Sn sheets that are also stable and the trends of comparable mechanical stability of the planar and buckled phases remain the same."}

  abstract = {Atomically thin boron nitride (BN) is an important 2D nanomaterial, with many properties distinct from graphene. In this feature article, these unique properties and associated applications, often not feasible with graphene, are outlined. The article starts with characterization and identification of atomically thin BN. It is followed by demonstrating their strong oxidation resistance at high temperatures and applications in protecting metals from oxidation and corrosion. As flat insulators, BN nanosheets are ideal dielectric substrates for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and electronic devices based on 2D heterostructures. The light emission of BN nanosheets in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) and ultraviolet (UV) regions is also included for its scientific and technological importance. The last part is dedicated to synthesis, characterization, and optical properties of BN nanoribbons, a special form of nanosheets.}

abstract  ="Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been under scientific investigation for more than fifteen years because of their unique properties that predestine them for many potential applications. The field of nanotechnology and nanoscience push their investigation forward to produce CNTs with suitable parameters for future applications. It is evident that new approaches of their synthesis need to be developed and optimized. In this paper we review history{,} types{,} structure and especially the different synthesis methods for CNTs preparation including arc discharge{,} laser ablation and chemical vapour deposition. Moreover{,} we mention some rarely used ways of arc discharge deposition which involves arc discharge in liquid solutions in contrary to standard used deposition in a gas atmosphere. In addition{,} the methods for uniform vertically aligned CNTs synthesis using lithographic techniques for catalyst deposition as well as a method utilizing a nanoporous anodized aluminium oxide as a pattern for selective CNTs growth are reported too."}

  abstract = {Graphene has been widely heralded over the last decade as one of the most promising nanomaterials for integrated, miniaturized applications spanning from nanoelectronics, interconnections, thermal management, sensing, to optoelectronics. Graphene grown on silicon carbide is currently the most likely candidate to fulfill this promise. As a matter of fact, the capability to synthesize high-quality graphene over large areas using processes and substrates compatible as much as possible with the well-established semiconductor manufacturing technologies is one crucial requirement. We review here, the enormous scientific and technological advances achieved in terms of epitaxial growth of graphene from thermal decomposition of bulk silicon carbide and the fine control of the graphene electronic properties through intercalation. Finally, we discuss perspectives on epitaxial graphene growth from silicon carbide on silicon, a particularly challenging area that could result in maximum benefit for the integration of graphene with silicon technologies.}

abstract ={Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron—electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density ρ. Q[ρ] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Ψρ which yield the fixed. ρ. Q[ρ] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron—electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix γ, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree—Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

  abstract={We show that the middle-range exchange-correlation hybrid of Henderson, Izmaylov, Scuseria and Savin (HISS) performs extremely well for elemental and binary semiconductors with narrow or visible spectrum band gaps, as well as some wider gap or more ionic systems used in devices. The lattice parameters are superior to those predicted by the screened hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof (HSE), and provide a significant improvement over the geometries predicted by typical semilocal functionals, yielding results competitive with PBEsol, which was specially tuned for solids. HISS also yields band gaps superior to those produced by functionals developed specifically for the solid state. Timings indicate that HISS is more computationally efficient than HSE, implying that the high quality lattice constants coupled with improved optical band gap predictions render HISS a useful adjunct to HSE in the modeling of geometry-sensitive semiconductors.}

	abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is now routinely used for simulating material properties. Many software packages are available, which makes it challenging to know which are the best to use for a specific calculation. Lejaeghere et al. compared the calculated values for the equation of states for 71 elemental crystals from 15 different widely used DFT codes employing 40 different potentials (see the Perspective by Skylaris). Although there were variations in the calculated values, most recent codes and methods converged toward a single value, with errors comparable to those of experiment.Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad3000; see also p. 1394INTRODUCTIONThe reproducibility of results is one of the underlying principles of science. An observation can only be accepted by the scientific community when it can be confirmed by independent studies. However, reproducibility does not come easily. Recent works have painfully exposed cases where previous conclusions were not upheld. The scrutiny of the scientific community has also turned to research involving computer programs, finding that reproducibility depends more strongly on implementation than commonly thought. These problems are especially relevant for property predictions of crystals and molecules, which hinge on precise computer implementations of the governing equation of quantum physics.RATIONALEThis work focuses on density functional theory (DFT), a particularly popular quantum method for both academic and industrial applications. More than 15,000 DFT papers are published each year, and DFT is now increasingly used in an automated fashion to build large databases or apply multiscale techniques with limited human supervision. Therefore, the reproducibility of DFT results underlies the scientific credibility of a substantial fraction of current work in the natural and engineering sciences. A plethora of DFT computer codes are available, many of them differing considerably in their details of implementation, and each yielding a certain {\textquotedblleft}precision{\textquotedblright} relative to other codes. How is one to decide for more than a few simple cases which code predicts the correct result, and which does not? We devised a procedure to assess the precision of DFT methods and used this to demonstrate reproducibility among many of the most widely used DFT codes. The essential part of this assessment is a pairwise comparison of a wide range of methods with respect to their predictions of the equations of state of the elemental crystals. This effort required the combined expertise of a large group of code developers and expert users.RESULTSWe calculated equation-of-state data for four classes of DFT implementations, totaling 40 methods. Most codes agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Even in the case of pseudization approaches, which largely depend on the atomic potentials used, a similar precision can be obtained as when using the full potential. The remaining deviations are due to subtle effects, such as specific numerical implementations or the treatment of relativistic terms.CONCLUSIONOur work demonstrates that the precision of DFT implementations can be determined, even in the absence of one absolute reference code. Although this was not the case 5 to 10 years ago, most of the commonly used codes and methods are now found to predict essentially identical results. The established precision of DFT codes not only ensures the reproducibility of DFT predictions but also puts several past and future developments on a firmer footing. Any newly developed methodology can now be tested against the benchmark to verify whether it reaches the same level of precision. New DFT applications can be shown to have used a sufficiently precise method. Moreover, high-precision DFT calculations are essential for developing improvements to DFT methodology, such as new density functionals, which may further increase the predictive power of the simulations.Recent DFT methods yield reproducible results.Whereas older DFT implementations predict different values (red darts), codes have now evolved to mutual agreement (green darts). The scoreboard illustrates the good pairwise agreement of four classes of DFT implementations (horizontal direction) with all-electron results (vertical direction). Each number reflects the average difference between the equations of state for a given pair of methods, with the green-to-red color scheme showing the range from the best to the poorest agreement.The widespread popularity of density functional theory has given rise to an extensive range of dedicated codes for predicting molecular and crystalline properties. However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements.},

abstract ={The massless Dirac spectrum of electrons in single-layer graphene has been thoroughly studied both theoretically and experimentally. Although a subject of considerable theoretical interest, experimental investigations of the richer electronic structure of few-layer graphene (FLG) have been limited. Here we examine FLG graphene crystals with Bernal stacking of layer thicknesses N = 1,2,3,…8 prepared using the mechanical exfoliation technique. For each layer thickness N, infrared conductivity measurements over the spectral range of 0.2–1.0 eV have been performed and reveal a distinctive band structure, with different conductivity peaks present below 0.5 eV and a relatively flat spectrum at higher photon energies. The principal transitions exhibit a systematic energy-scaling behavior with N. These observations are explained within a unified zone-folding scheme that generates the electronic states for all FLG materials from that of the bulk 3D graphite crystal through imposition of appropriate boundary conditions. Using the Kubo formula, we find that the complete infrared conductivity spectra for the different FLG crystals can be reproduced reasonably well within the framework a tight-binding model.},

Although 2D Diracmaterials possess many novel properties and physics, they are rare compared with the numerous 2Dmaterials. To provide explanation for the rarity of 2D Diracmaterials aswell as clues in searching for new Dirac systems, herewe review the recent theoretical aspects of various 2D Diracmaterials, including graphene, silicene, germanene, graphynes, several boron and carbon sheets, transition-metal oxides (VO2)n/(TiO2)m and (CrO2)n/(TiO2)m, organic and organometallic crystals, so-MoS2, and artificial lattices (electron gases and ultracold atoms). Their structural and electronic properties are summarized.Wealso investigate howDirac points emerge, move, and merge in these systems. The vonNeumann–Wigner theorem is used to explain the scarcity of Dirac cones in 2D systems, which leads to rigorous requirements on the symmetry, parameters, Fermi level, and band overlap ofmaterials to achieve Dirac cones. Connections between existence ofDirac cones and the structural features are also discussed.},

A criterion was derived under a tight-binding approximation for the existence of Dirac cones in the atomic crystal. When the transfer hoppings are assumed to be single functions of the distance between atoms{,} it was shown that the probability of observing Dirac cones in the atomic crystal gradually decreases before being reduced to zero when the lattice changes from hexagonal to square. For a 2DEG with full square symmetry{,} a Dirac point exists at the Brillouin zone corners{,} where the energy dispersion is parabolic not linear. These results suggest that conventional Dirac fermions (such as those in graphene) are difficult to achieve in a square lattice with full symmetry (wallpaper group p4mm)."}
